## Seeking Partners in Africa to Build an Innovation Research Network on AI for Climate Action

We are pleased to announce a call ([EN](https://ai4d.ai/calls/climate-action-hub/){:target="_blank"}, [FR](https://ai4d.ai/fr/calls/climate-action-hub/){:target="_blank"}) for expressions of interest to develop a $1M research hub in Africa focusing on artificial intelligence for climate action.

The new grant initiative—part of the four-year Artificial Intelligence for Development in Africa (AI4D Africa) program—is a collaboration between Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC), the Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), and Climate Change AI.

The mission of the selected hub will be to advance the responsible development and deployment of AI innovations across Africa that tackle the pressing challenges of climate change.

**What:** A 1.2 million CAD grant to design and implement a research network of African researchers and innovators, focused on applying responsible AI techniques to advance climate action in Africa and beyond. A minimum of 55% of this grant should be sub-granted to projects in the broader research network.

**Who:** The call is open to non-governmental organizations based in lower and lower-middle income countries (LLMIC) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), or consortia of up to three organizations with the lead organization based in an LLMIC in SSA.

**When:** Submissions must be received by April 05, 2021 23:59 (EDT).

**How:** Expressions of interest should be submitted to <AI4DAfrica@idrc.ca>. More details on submission format and content are available on the [AI4D website](https://ai4d.ai/calls/climate-action-hub/){:target="_blank"}.
