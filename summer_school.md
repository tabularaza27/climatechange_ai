## About

The goal of the course is to provide a comprehensive overview of machine learning applications in a broad range of climate change-related fields. This includes covering  the foundational ML methods and state-of-the-art tools, while underlining their advantages and limitations, and describing how they can be used in practice to address the climate crisis. Topics include, but are not limited to, the following areas:
  - Agriculture 
  - Behavioral and social science
  - Buildings and cities
  - Carbon capture and sequestration
  - Climate finance and economics
  - Climate justice
  - Climate modeling
  - Climate policy
  - Disaster prediction, management, and relief
  - Earth science and monitoring
  - Ecosystems and natural systems
  - Forestry and other land use
  - Heavy industry and manufacturing
  - Power and energy systems
  - Societal adaptation
  - Transportation
  - Course Structure

The curricular part of the course is organized in two tracks designed to better provide an enriching and accessible learning experience to participants with different backgrounds. The course is structured for students and graduates of a university-level degree, preferably with a general understanding of statistics and working knowledge of programming gained through formal or informal courses. The full course content and tutorial materials will be provided in English and the code exercises will use the Python programming language. 

The project part of the course will consist of a group project at the intersection of climate change and machine learning. Participants from both tracks will collaborate in a multidisciplinary team and apply the skills they have learned throughout the summer school to develop a project focused on a specific use case. Each group will have the support of a mentor who will advise the team throughout the duration of the project.

### Tracks 
#### AI-Focused Track
This track is designed for participants who have expertise in a climate change related field but do not have a background in AI. 

**Pre-requisites:** If you don’t have any background in AI/ML or Python, it would be beneficial for you to complete a free online course on introduction to ML/AI, and an introduction to Python and Jupyter Notebooks (from a provided list of free resources).

**Content:**
  - Introductory lectures on AI and its applications to climate change
  - Hands-on tutorials including code-based exercises covering the application of machine learning methods to problems relevant to climate change using modern tools
  - A project where students can leverage their expertise in a climate change related field and collaborate with fellow summer school participants with AI expertise

#### Climate-Focused Track
This track is designed for students who have expertise in AI but may or may not have a background in a climate change related field. Students applying for this track should have a theoretical and practical understanding of AI and be able to formulate AI approaches  to  new problems.
 
**Pre-requisites:** If you do not have any background in the drivers of climate change, it would be beneficial for you to complete a free online course introduction to climate change and climate modelling (from a provided list of free resources).
 
**Content:**
   - Introductory lectures on climate change and relevant AI applications in this space
   - Hands-on tutorials with practical examples covering various opportunities and challenges to address climate change with state-of-the-art AI tools
   - A project where students can leverage their expertise in AI and collaborate with fellow summer school participants  with climate change expertise


## Call for Participation

We welcome applications from students, researchers, and practitioners in the public and private sector who are interested in using machine learning to address problems in climate change mitigation, adaptation, or climate science. Applicants must be at least 18 years of age. 
 
Applications are due by: Dec 1 AOE (Anywhere on Earth). To apply you are required to submit your application through this form:
https://forms.gle/9eSETySjVvdzkfiM6

The form is editable until the submission deadline, but please note that applications that are missing required information such as a curriculum vitae will not be considered.

The cohort will be composed of applicants from multidisciplinary areas, to be selected on the basis of their background and experience as well as their motivation for joining the summer school.  Admission notifications will be sent out by the end of February. 

The summer school is free to attend. Applicants who are accepted will be notified to confirm their attendance for the entire duration of the summer school.

For further inquiries please contact summerschool@climatechange.ai

<!-- ## FAQ

### Eligibility

_Q: Does my institution qualify as an "accredited university or academic research institution" under the eligibility criteria of this grant?_<br>
A: For the purposes of this grant, we consider any officially-recognized non-profit academic institution with faculty to be an "accredited university or academic research institution," and therefore eligible to be a lead institution on a proposal. If you’re unsure as to whether your institution qualifies under these criteria, feel free to email us at <grants@climatechange.ai>.

_Q: I am from a US national lab. Does this count as an eligible "academic research institution"?_<br>
A: US national labs and federally funded research and development centers (FFRDCs) are unfortunately not eligible to be the lead institution on a proposal.

_Q: I am from an eligible “accredited university or academic research institution” as defined above and hold a post-PhD research position at that institution, but am not technically considered either a postdoc or faculty member. Am I eligible to be a PI?_<br>
A: Yes. Anyone at an eligible lead institution as defined above who holds a post-PhD research position of postdoctoral level or above, and is allowed by their institution to hold grants, is eligible to apply as a PI. -->
