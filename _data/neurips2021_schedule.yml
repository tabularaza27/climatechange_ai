    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Is AI the Solution to Climate Change</p>
    
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Many pin their hopes on the tech sector and advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other digital technologies in combating climate change. In this talk, I argue against this optimistic view. I first provide evidence on how AI has been used in US businesses, pointing out that it has had few of the promised benefits and has instead continued the process of inequality-increasing and wage-reducing automation. I then review the evidence on advances in renewable energy, arguing that it has responded strongly to subsidies and prices of fossil fuels, but these advances have slowed down lately. There appears to be no alternative to increasing carbon taxes significantly and investing in renewable and green technologies. There is no evidence that big tech companies have played a leading role, and most existing evidence suggests that big energy companies have typically undermined efforts to switch to renewables.</p>

    <p><strong>Title:</strong> Developing Trustworthy AI for Weather and Climate</p>
    
    <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> In this talk we give an overview of the work of the NSF AI Institute for Research on Trustworthy AI in Weather, Climate, and Coastal Oceanography. For this talk, we will focus on our applications to weather and climate predictions, including convective hazards and extreme heat.  We also briefly review the need for the development of principles for ethical and responsible AI for weather and climate.</p>
