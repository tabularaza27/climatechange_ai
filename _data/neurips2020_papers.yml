- paper_title: Electric Vehicle Range Improvement by Utilizing Deep Learning to Optimize
    Occupant Thermal Comfort
  abstract: Heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems can have a significant
    impact on the driving range of battery electric vehicles (EV’s). Predicting thermal
    comfort in an automotive vehicle cabin’s highly asymmetric and dynamic thermal
    environment is critical for developing energy-efficient HVAC systems. In this
    study we have coupled high-fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations
    and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict vehicle occupant thermal comfort
    for any combination of steady-state boundary conditions. A vehicle cabin CFD model,
    validated against climatic wind tunnel measurements, was used to systematically
    generate training and test data that spanned the entire range of boundary conditions
    which impact occupant thermal comfort in an electric vehicle. Artificial neural
    networks (ANN) were applied to the simulation data to predict the overall Equivalent
    Homogeneous Temperature (EHT) comfort index for each occupant. An ensemble of
    five neural network models was able to achieve a mean absolute error of 2 ºC or
    less in predicting the overall EHT for all occupants in the vehicle on unseen
    or test data, which is acceptable for rapid evaluation and optimization of thermal
    comfort energy demand. The deep learning model developed in this work enables
    predictions of thermal comfort for any combination of steady-state boundary conditions
    in real-time without being limited by time-consuming and expensive CFD simulations
    or climatic wind tunnel tests. This model has been deployed as an easy-to-use
    web application within the organization for HVAC engineers to optimize thermal
    comfort energy demand and, thereby, driving range of electric vehicle programs.

- paper_title: Is Africa leapfrogging to renewables or heading for carbon lock-in?
    A machine-learning-based approach to predicting success of power-generation projects
  abstract: 'Several extant energy-planning studies, comprising wide-ranging assumptions
    about the future, feature projections of Africa’s rapid transition in the next
    decade towards renewables-based power generation. Here, we develop a novel empirical
    approach to predicting medium-term generation mix that can complement traditional
    energy planning. Relying on the largest dataset on historic and planned power
    plants available for Africa, combined with country-level characteristics, we build
    a machine-learning-based model, using gradient boosted trees, that demonstrates
    high predictive performance. Training our model on past successful and failed
    projects, we find that the most relevant factors for commissioning are plant-level:
    capacity, fuel, ownership and grid connection type. We then apply the trained
    model to predict the realisation of the current project pipeline. Contrary to
    the rapid transition scenarios, our results show that the share of non-hydro renewables
    in generation is likely to remain below 10% in 2030, despite total generation
    more than doubling. These findings point to high carbon lock-in risks in Africa,
    highlighting the urgency to shift its pipeline of projects towards low-carbon
    energy and improve the realisation chances of renewable energy plants.'

- paper_title: 'pymgrid: An Open-Source Python Microgrid Simulator for Applied Artificial
    Intelligence Research'
  abstract: Microgrids – self-contained electrical grids that are capable of disconnecting
    from the main grid – hold potential in both tackling climate change mitigation
    via reducing CO$_2$ emissions and adaptation by increasing infrastructure resiliency.
    Due to their distributed nature, microgrids are often idiosyncratic; as a result,
    control of these systems is nontrivial. While  microgrid simulators exist, many
    are limited in scope and in the variety of microgrids they can simulate. We propose
    \HL{pymgrid}, an open-source Python package to generate and simulate a large number
    of microgrids, and the first open-source tool that can generate more than 600
    different microgrids. \HL{pymgrid} abstracts most of the domain expertise, allowing
    users to focus on control algorithms. In particular, \HL{pymgrid} is built to
    be a reinforcement learning (RL) platform, and includes the ability to model microgrids
    as Markov decision processes. \HL{pymgrid} also introduces two pre-computed list
    of microgrids, intended to allow for research reproducibility in the microgrid
    setting.

- paper_title: Towards Optimal District Heating Temperature Control in China with
    Deep Reinforcement Learning
  abstract: Achieving efficiency gains in Chinese district heating networks, thereby
    reducing their carbon footprint, requires new optimal control methods going beyond
    current industry tools. Focusing on the secondary network, we propose a data-driven
    deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach to address this task. We build a recurrent
    neural network, trained on simulated data, to predict the indoor temperatures.
    This model is then used to train two DRL agents, with or without expert guidance,
    for the optimal control of the supply water temperature. Our tests in a multi-apartment
    setting show that both agents can ensure a higher thermal comfort and at the same
    time a smaller energy cost, compared to an optimized baseline strategy.

- paper_title: Deep Reinforcement Learning in Electricity Generation Investment for
    the Minimization of Long-Term Carbon Emissions and Electricity Costs
  abstract: "A change from a high-carbon emitting electricity power system to one
    based on renewables would aid in the mitigation of climate change. Decarbonization
    of the electricity grid would allow for low-carbon heating, cooling and transport.
    Investments in renewable energy must be made over a long time horizon to maximise
    return of investment of these long life power generators. Over these long time
    horizons, there exist multiple uncertainties, for example in future electricity
    demand and costs to consumers and investors. \n\nTo mitigate for imperfect information
    of the future, we use the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) deep reinforcement
    learning approach to optimize for a low-cost, low-carbon electricity supply using
    a modified version of the FTT:Power model. In this work, we model the UK and Ireland
    electricity markets. The DDPG algorithm is able to learn the optimum electricity
    mix through experience and achieves this between the years of 2017 and 2050. We
    find that a change from fossil fuels and nuclear power to renewables, based upon
    wind, solar and wave would provide a cheap and low-carbon alternative to fossil
    fuels."

- paper_title: Short-Term Solar Irradiance Forecasting Using Calibrated Probabilistic
    Models
  abstract: Advancing probabilistic solar forecasting methods is essential to supporting
    the integration of solar energy into the electricity grid. In this work, we develop
    a variety of state-of-the-art probabilistic models for forecasting solar irradiance.
    We investigate the use of post-hoc calibration techniques for ensuring well-calibrated
    probabilistic predictions. We train and evaluate the models using public data
    from seven stations in the SURFRAD network, and demonstrate that the best model,
    NGBoost, achieves higher performance at an intra-hourly resolution than the best
    benchmark solar irradiance forecasting model across all stations. Further, we
    show that NGBoost with CRUDE post-hoc calibration achieves comparable performance
    to a numerical weather prediction model on hourly-resolution forecasting.

- paper_title: Deep Learning for Climate Model Output Statistics
  abstract: Climate models are an important tool for the assessment of prospective
    climate change effects but they suffer from systematic and representation errors,
    especially for precipitation. Model output statistics (MOS) reduce these errors
    by fitting the model output to observational data with machine learning. In this
    work, we explore the feasibility and potential of deep learning with convolutional
    neural networks (CNNs) for MOS. We propose the CNN architecture ConvMOS specifically
    designed for reducing errors in climate model outputs and apply it to the climate
    model REMO. Our results show a considerable reduction of errors and mostly improved
    performance compared to three commonly used MOS approaches.

- paper_title: A Temporally Consistent Image-based Sun Tracking Algorithm for Solar
    Energy Forecasting Applications
  abstract: Improving irradiance forecasting is critical to further increase the share
    of solar in the energy mix. On a short time scale, fish-eye cameras on the ground
    are used to capture cloud displacements causing the local variability of the electricity
    production. As most of the solar radiation comes directly from the Sun, current
    forecasting approaches use its position in the image as a reference to interpret
    the cloud cover dynamics. However, existing Sun tracking methods rely on external
    data and a calibration of the camera, which requires access to the device. To
    address these limitations, this study introduces an image-based Sun tracking algorithm
    to localise the Sun in the image when it is visible and interpolate its daily
    trajectory from past observations. We validate the method on a set of sky images
    collected over a year at SIRTA's lab. Experimental results show that the proposed
    method provides robust smooth Sun trajectories with a mean absolute error below
    1% of the image size.

- paper_title: Characterization of Industrial Smoke Plumes from Remote Sensing Data
  abstract: |-
    The major driver of global warming has been identified as the anthropogenic release of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from industrial activities. The quantitative monitoring of these emissions is mandatory to fully understand their effect on the Earth’s climate and to enforce emission regulations on a large scale. In this work, we investigate the possibility to detect and quantify industrial smoke plumes from globally and freely available multi-band image data from ESA’s Sentinel-2 satellites. Using a modified ResNet-50, we can detect smoke plumes of different sizes with an accuracy of 94.3%. The model correctly ignores natural clouds and focuses on those imaging channels that are related to the spectral absorption from aerosols and water vapor, enabling the localization of smoke. We exploit this localization ability and train a U-Net segmentation model on a labeled sub-sample of our data, resulting in an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) metric of 0.608 and an overall accuracy for the detection of any smoke plume of 94.0%; on average, our model can reproduce the area covered by smoke in an image to within 5.6%. The performance of our model is mostly limited by occasional confusion with surface objects, the inability to identify semi-transparent smoke, and human limitations to properly identify smoke based on RGB-only images. Nevertheless, our results enable us to reliably detect and qualitatively estimate the level of smoke activity in order to monitor activity in industrial plants across the globe. Our data set and
    code base are publicly available.

- paper_title: Learning the distribution of extreme precipitation from atmospheric
    general circulation model variables
  abstract: Precipitation extremes are projected to become more frequent and severe
    in a warming atmosphere over the coming decades. However, the accurate prediction
    of precipitation, in particular of extremes, remains a challenge for numerical
    weather prediction models. A large source of error are subgrid-scale parameterizations
    of processes that play a crucial role in the complex, multi-scale dynamics of
    precipitation, but are not explicitly resolved in the model formulation. Here
    we follow a hybrid, data-driven approach, in which atmospheric variables such
    as wind fields are forecast in time by a general circulation model (GCM) ensemble
    and then mapped to precipitation using a deep convolutional autoencoder. A frequency-based
    weighting of the loss function is introduced to improve the learning with regard
    to extreme values. Our results show an improved representation of extreme precipitation
    frequencies, as well as better error and correlation statistics compared to a
    state-of-the-art GCM ensemble.

- paper_title: Towards Tracking the Emissions of Every Power Plant on the Planet
  abstract: Greenhouse gases emitted from fossil-fuel-burning power plants are a major
    contributor to climate change. Current methods to track emissions from individual
    sources are expensive and only used in a few countries. While carbon dioxide concentrations
    can be measured globally using remote sensing, background fluctuations and low
    spatial resolution make it difficult to attribute emissions to individual sources.
    We use machine learning to infer power generation and emissions from visible and
    thermal power plant signatures in satellite images. By training on a data set
    of power plants for which we know the generation or emissions, we are able to
    apply our models globally. This paper demonstrates initial progress on this project
    by predicting whether a power plant is on or off from a single satellite image.

- paper_title: Spatio-Temporal Learning for Feature Extraction inTime-Series Images
  abstract: 'Earth observation programs have provided highly useful information in
    global climate change research over the past few decades and greatly promoted
    its development, especially through providing biological, physical, and chemical
    parameters on a global scale. Programs such as Landsat, Sentinel, SPOT, and Pleiades
    can be used to acquire huge volume of medium to high resolution images every day.
    In this work, we organize these data in time series and we exploit both temporal
    and spatial information they provide to generate accurate and up-to-date land
    cover maps that can be used to monitor vulnerable areas threatened by the ongoing
    climatic and anthropogenic global changes. For  this  purpose,  we  combine  a  fully  convolutional  neural  network  with
    a  convolutional  long  short-term  memory.   Implementation  details  of  the  proposed  spatio-temporal  neural  network  architecture  are
    described. Examples are provided for the monitoring of roads and mangrove forests
    on the West African coast. '

- paper_title: Meta-modeling strategy for data-driven forecasting
  abstract: Accurately forecasting the weather is a key requirement for climate change
    mitigation. Data-driven methods offer the ability to make more accurate forecasts,
    but lack interpretability and can be expensive to train and deploy if models are
    not carefully developed. Here, we make use of two historical climate data sets
    and tools from machine learning, to accurately predict temperature fields. Furthermore,
    we are able to use low fidelity models that are cheap to train and evaluate, to
    selectively avoid expensive high fidelity function evaluations, as well as uncover
    seasonal variations in predictive power. This allows for an adaptive training
    strategy for computationally efficient geophysical emulation.

- paper_title: Short-term prediction of photovoltaic power generation using Gaussian
    process regression
  abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) power is affected by weather conditions, making the
    power generated from the PV systems uncertain. Solving this problem would help
    improve the reliability and cost effectiveness of the grid, and could help reduce
    reliance on fossil fuel plants. The present paper focuses on evaluating predictions
    of the energy generated by PV systems in the United Kingdom using Gaussian process
    regression (GPR). Gaussian process regression is a Bayesian non-parametric model
    that can provide predictions along with the uncertainty in the predicted value,
    which can be very useful in applications with a high degree of uncertainty. The
    model is evaluated for short-term forecasts of 48 hours against three main factors
    – training period, sky area coverage and kernel model selection – and for very
    short-term forecasts of four hours against sky area. We also compare very short-term
    forecasts in terms of cloud coverage within the prediction period and only initial
    cloud coverage as a predictor.

- paper_title: 'Formatting the Landscape: Spatial conditional GAN for varying population
    in satellite imagery'
  abstract: 'Climate change is expected to reshuffle the settlement landscape: forcing
    people in affected areas to migrate, to change their lifeways, and continuing
    to affect demographic change throughout the world. Changes to the geographic distribution
    of population will have dramatic impacts on land use and land cover and thus constitute
    one of the major challenges of planning for climate change scenarios. In this
    paper, we explore a generative model framework for generating satellite imagery
    conditional on gridded population distributions. We make additions to the existing
    ALAE [30] architecture, creating a spatially conditional version: SCALAE. This
    method allows us to explicitly disentangle population from the model’s latent
    space and thus input custom population forecasts into the generated imagery. We
    postulate that such imagery could then be directly used for land cover and land
    use change estimation using existing frameworks, as well as for realistic visualisation
    of expected local change. We evaluate the model by comparing pixel and semantic
    reconstructions, as well as calculate the standard FID metric. The results suggest
    the model captures population distributions accurately and delivers a controllable
    method to generate realistic satellite imagery.'

    Molecular Performance for Redox Flow Batteries'
  abstract: Energy storage is an important tool in the decarbonization of energy systems,
    particularly when coupled with intermittent forms of energy. However, storage
    technologies are still not commercially competitive to garner mainstream adoption.
    This work focuses on the cost reduction of organic redox flow batteries (ORFBs)
    via materials discovery. We identify macroscopic metrics of interest to optimize
    for lowering their cost and relate them to the molecular properties of the materials
    involved. Furthermore, we consolidate a benchmark set of experimental data for
    building predictive models for these materials properties. Building more accurate
    models will aid practitioners in the rational design of new ORFB.

- paper_title: Predicting Landsat Reflectance with Deep Generative Fusion
  abstract: Public satellite missions are commonly bound to a trade-off between spatial
    and temporal resolution as no single sensor provides fine-grained acquisitions
    with frequent coverage. This hinders their potential to assist vegetation monitoring
    or humanitarian actions, which require detecting rapid and detailed terrestrial
    surface changes. In this work, we probe the potential of deep generative models
    to produce high-resolution optical imagery by fusing products with different spatial
    and temporal characteristics. We introduce a dataset of co-registered Moderate
    Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Landsat surface reflectance time
    series and demonstrate the ability of our generative model to blend coarse daily
    reflectance information into low-paced finer acquisitions. We benchmark our proposed
    model against state-of-the-art reflectance fusion algorithms.

- paper_title: Quantitative Assessment of Drought Impacts Using XGBoost based on the
    Drought Impact Reporter
  abstract: Under climate change, the increasing frequency, intensity, and spatial
    extent of drought events lead to higher socio-economic costs. However, the relationships
    between the hydro-meteorological indicators and drought impacts are not identified
    well yet because of the complexity and data scarcity. In this paper, we proposed
    a framework based on the extreme gradient model (XGBoost) for Texas to predict
    multi-category drought impacts and connected a typical drought indicator, Standardized
    Precipitation Index (SPI), to the text-based impacts from the Drought Impact Reporter
    (DIR). The preliminary results of this study showed an outstanding performance
    of the well-trained models to assess drought impacts on agriculture, fire, society
    & public health, plants & wildlife, as well as relief, response & restrictions
    in Texas. It also provided a possibility to appraise drought impacts using hydro-meteorological
    indicators with the proposed framework in the United States, which could help
    drought risk management by giving additional information and improving the updating
    frequency of drought impacts. Our interpretation results using the Shapley additive
    explanation (SHAP) interpretability technique revealed that the rules guiding
    the predictions of XGBoost comply with domain expertise knowledge around the role
    that SPI indicators play around drought impacts.

    Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
  abstract: Forest fires, such as those on the US west coast in September 2020, are
    an important factor in climate change. Wildfire modeling and mitigation require
    mapping vegetation ground cover over large plots of land. The current forestry
    practice is to send out human ground crews to collect photos of the forest floor
    at precisely determined locations, then manually calculate the percent cover of
    ground fuel types. In this work, we propose automating this process using a supervised
    learning-based deep convolutional neural network to perform image segmentation.
    Experimental results on a real dataset show this approach delivers very promising
    performance.

- paper_title: A Machine Learning Approach to Methane Emissions Mitigation in the
    Oil and Gas Industry
  abstract: Reducing methane emissions from the oil and gas sector is a key component
    of climate policy in the United States. Methane leaks across the supply chain
    are stochastic and intermittent, with a small number of sites (‘super-emitters’)
    responsible for a majority of emissions. Thus, cost-effective emissions reduction
    critically relies on effectively identifying the super-emitters from thousands
    of well-sites and millions of miles of pipelines. Conventional approaches such
    as walking surveys using optical gas imaging technology are slow and time-consuming.
    In addition, several variables contribute to the formation of leaks such as infrastructure
    age, production, weather conditions, and maintenance practices. Here, we develop
    a machine learning algorithm to predict high-emitting sites that can be prioritized
    for follow-up repair. Such prioritization can significantly reduce the cost of
    surveys and increase emissions reductions compared to conventional approaches.
    Our results show that the algorithm using logistic regression performs the best
    out of several algorithms. The model achieved a 70% accuracy rate with a 57% recall
    and a 66% balanced accuracy rate. Compared to the conventional approach, the machine
    learning model reduced the time to achieve a 50% emissions mitigation target by
    42%. Correspondingly, the mitigation cost reduced from $85/t CO2e to $49/t CO2e.

  abstract: 'One of the impacts of climate change is the difficulty of tree regrowth
    after wildfires over areas that traditionally were covered by certain tree species.
    Here a deep learning model is customized to classify land covers from four-band
    aerial imagery before and after wildfires to study the prolonged consequences
    of wildfires on tree species. The tree species labels are generated from manually
    delineated maps for five land cover classes: Conifer, Hardwood, Shrub, ReforestedTree,
    and Barren land. With an accuracy of 92% on the test split, the model is applied
    to three wildfires on data from 2009 to 2018. The model accurately delineates
    areas damaged by wildfires, changes in tree species, and regrowth in burned areas.
    The result shows clear evidence of wildfires impacting the local ecosystem and
    the outlined approach can help monitor reforested areas, observe changes in forest
    composition, and track wildfire impact on tree species.'

    Deep Learning on Satellite Imagery'
  abstract: Characterizing the processes leading to deforestation is critical to the
    development and implementation of targeted forest conservation and management
    policies. In this work, we develop a deep learning model called ForestNet to classify
    the drivers of primary forest loss in Indonesia, a country with one of the highest
    deforestation rates in the world. Using satellite imagery, ForestNet identifies
    the direct drivers of deforestation in forest loss patches of any size. We curate
    a dataset of Landsat 8 satellite images of known forest loss events paired with
    driver annotations from expert interpreters. We use the dataset to train and validate
    the models and demonstrate that ForestNet substantially outperforms other standard
    driver classification approaches. In order to support future research on automated
    approaches to deforestation driver classification, the dataset curated in this
    study is publicly available at https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/forestnet

- paper_title: Mangrove Ecosystem Detection using Mixed-Resolution Imagery with a
    Hybrid-Convolutional Neural Network
  abstract: 'Mangrove forests are rich in biodiversity and are a large contributor
    to carbon sequestration critical in the fight against climate change. However,
    they are currently under threat from anthropogenic activities, so monitoring their
    health, extent, and productivity is vital to our ability to protect these important
    ecosystems. Traditionally, lower resolution satellite imagery or high resolution
    unmanned air vehicle (UAV) imagery has been used independently to monitor mangrove
    extent, both offering helpful features to predict mangrove extent. To take advantage
    of both of these data sources, we propose the use of a hybrid neural network,
    which combines a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature extractor with a Multilayer-Perceptron
    (MLP), to accurately detect mangrove areas using both medium resolution satellite
    and high resolution drone imagery. We present a comparison of our novel Hybrid
    CNN with algorithms previously applied to mangrove image classification on a data
    set we collected of dwarf mangroves from consumer UAVs in Baja California Sur,
    Mexico, and show a 95\% intersection over union (IOU) score for mangrove image
    classification, outperforming all our baselines.

- paper_title: Context-Aware Urban Energy Efficiency Optimization Using Hybrid Physical
    Models
  abstract: Buildings produce more U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through electricity
    generation than any other economic sector. To improve the energy efficiency of
    buildings, engineers often rely on physics-based building simulations to predict
    the impacts of retrofits in individual buildings. In dense urban areas, these
    models suffer from inaccuracy due to imprecise parameterization or external, unmodeled
    urban context factors such as inter-building effects and urban microclimates.
    In a case study of approximately 30 buildings in Sacramento, California, we demonstrate
    how our hybrid physics-driven deep learning framework can use these external factors
    advantageously to identify a more optimal energy efficiency retrofit installation
    strategy and achieve significant savings in both energy and cost.

  abstract: We present a systematic comparison between neural network (NN) architectures
    for inference of AC-OPF solutions. Using fully connected NNs as a baseline we
    demonstrate the efficacy of leveraging network topology in the models by constructing
    abstract representations of electrical grids in the graph domain, for both convolutional
    and graph NNs. The performance of the NN architectures is compared for regression
    (predicting optimal generator set-points) and classification (predicting the active
    set of constraints) settings. Computational gains for obtaining optimal solutions
    are also presented.

- paper_title: Predicting the Solar Potential of Rooftops using Image Segmentation
    and Structured Data
  abstract: 'Estimating the amount of electricity that can be produced by rooftop
    photovoltaic systems is a time-consuming process that requires on-site measurements,
    a difficult task to achieve on a large scale. In this paper, we present an approach
    to estimate the solar potential of rooftops based on their location and architectural
    characteristics, as well as the amount of solar radiation they receive annually.
    Our technique uses computer vision to achieve semantic segmentation of roof sections
    and roof objects on the one hand, and a machine learning model based on structured
    building features to predict roof pitch on the other hand. We then compute the
    azimuth and maximum number of solar panels that can be installed on a rooftop
    with geometric approaches. Finally, we compute precise shading masks and combine
    them with solar irradiation data that enables us to estimate the yearly solar
    potential of a rooftop. '

- paper_title: Revealing the Oil Majors' Adaptive Capacity to the Energy Transition
    with Deep Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
  abstract: A low-carbon energy transition is transpiring to combat climate change,
    posing an existential threat to oil and gas companies, particularly the Majors.
    Though Majors yield the resources and expertise to adapt to low-carbon business
    models, meaningful climate-aligned strategies have yet to be enacted. A 2-degrees
    pathways (2DP) wargame was developed to assess climate-compatible pathways for
    the oil Majors. Recent advances in deep multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL)
    have achieved superhuman-level performance in solving high-dimensional continuous
    control problems. Modeling within a Markovian framework, we present the novel
    2DP-MARL model which applies deep MARL methods to solve the 2DP wargame across
    a multitude of transition scenarios. Designed to best mimic Majors in real- life
    competition, the model reveals all Majors quickly adapt to low-carbon business
    models to remain robust amidst energy transition uncertainty. The purpose of this
    work is provide tangible metrics to support the call for oil Majors to diversify
    into low-carbon business models and, thus, accelerate the energy transition.

- paper_title: Quantifying the presence of air pollutants over a road network in high
    spatio-temporal resolution
  abstract: 'Monitoring air pollution plays a key role when trying to reduce its impact
    on the environment and on human health. Traditionally, two main sources of information
    about the quantity of pollutants over a city are used: monitoring stations at
    ground-level (when available), and satellites'' remote sensing. In addition to
    these two, other methods have been developed in the last years that aim at understanding
    how traffic emissions behave in space and time at a finer scale, taking into account
    the human mobility patterns. We present a simple and versatile framework for estimating
    the quantity of four air pollutants (CO2, NOx, PM, VOC) emitted by private vehicles
    moving on a road network, starting from raw GPS traces and information about vehicles''
    fuel type, and use this framework for analyses on how such pollutants distribute
    over the road networks of different cities.'

- paper_title: Annual and in-season mapping of cropland at field scale with sparse
    labels
  abstract: Spatial information about where crops are being grown, known as cropland
    maps, are critical inputs for analyses and decision-making related to food security
    and climate change. Despite a widespread need for readily-updated annual and in-season
    cropland maps at the management (field) scale, these maps are unavailable for
    most regions at risk of food insecurity. This is largely due to lack of in-situ
    labels for training and validating machine learning classifiers. Previously, we
    developed a method for binary classification of cropland that learns from sparse
    local labels and abundant global labels using a multi-headed LSTM and time-series
    multispectral satellite inputs over one year. In this work, we present a new method
    that uses an autoregressive LSTM to classify cropland during the growing season
    (i.e., partially-observed time series). We used these methods to produce publicly-available
    10m-resolution cropland maps in Kenya for the 2019-2020 and 2020-2021 growing
    seasons. These are the highest-resolution and most recent cropland maps publicly
    available for Kenya. These methods and associated maps are critical for scientific
    studies and decision-making at the intersection of food security and climate change.

  abstract: The recent explosion in applications of machine learning to satellite

    during the night. The gap can be filled by employing available infra-red observations
    to generate visible images. This work presents how Deep Learning can be applied
    successfully to create those images by using U-Net based architectures. The proposed
    methods show promising results, achieving a structural similarity index (SSIM)
    up to 86\% on an independent test set and providing visually convincing output
    images, generated from infra-red observations.

- paper_title: Analyzing Sustainability Reports Using Natural Language Processing
  abstract: Climate change is a far-reaching, global phenomenon that will impact many
    aspects of our society, including the global stock market. In recent years, companies
    have increasingly been aiming to both mitigate their environmental impact and
    adapt their practices the changing climate context. This is reported via increasingly
    exhaustive reports, which cover many types of sustainability measures, often under
    the umbrella of Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) disclosures. However,
    given this abundance of data, sustainability analysts are obliged to comb through
    hundreds of pages of reports in order to find relevant information. We have leveraged
    recent progress in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to create a custom model,
    ClimateQA, which allows the analysis of financial reports in order to identify
    climate-relevant sections using a question answering approach. We present this
    tool and the methodology that we used to develop it in the present article.

- paper_title: Automated Identification of Oil Field Features using CNNs
  abstract: 'Oil and gas production sites have been identified as a major source of
    anthropogenic methane emissions. Emissions studies utilize counts of equipment
    to estimate emissions from production facilities. However these counts are poorly
    documented, including both information about well pad locations and major equipment
    on each well pad. While these data can be found by manually reviewing satellite
    imagery, it is prohibitively difficult and time consuming. This work, part of
    a larger study of methane emission studies in Colorado, US, adapted a machine
    learning (ML) algorithm to detect well pads and associated equipment. Our initial
    model showed an average well pad detection accuracy of 95% on the Denver-Julesburg
    (DJ) basin in northeastern Colorado. Our example demonstrates the potential for
    this type of automated detection from satellite imagery, leading to more accurate
    and complete models of production emissions.

- paper_title: Using attention to model long-term dependencies in occupancy behavior
  abstract: Over the past years, more and more models have been published that aim
    to capture relationships in human residential behavior. Most of these models are
    different Markov variants or regression models that have a strong assumption bias
    and are therefore unable to capture complex long-term dependencies and the diversity
    in occupant behavior. This work shows that attention based models are able to
    capture complex long-term dependencies in occupancy behavior and at the same time
    adequately depict the diversity in behavior across the entire population and different
    socio-demographic groups. By combining an autoregressive generative model with
    an imputation model, the advantages of two data sets are combined and new data
    are generated which are beneficial for multiple use cases (e.g. generation of
    consistent household energy demand profiles). The two step approach generates
    synthetic activity schedules that have similar statistical properties as the empirical
    collected schedules and do not contain direct information about single individuals.
    Therefore, the presented approach forms the basis to make data on occupant behavior
    freely available, so that further investigations based on the synthetic data can
    be carried out without a large data application effort. In future work it is planned
    to take interpersonal dependencies into account in order to be able to generate
    entire household behavior profiles.

  abstract: 'To address the mounting destruction caused by floods in climate-vulnerable

    We propose this approach as a solution to the labor-intensive task of generating
    high-quality, hand-labeled training data, and demonstrate successes and failures
    of different plausible crowdsourcing approaches in our model. Street to Cloud
    leverages community reporting and machine learning to generate novel, near-real

- paper_title: Accurate river level predictions using a Wavenet-like model
  abstract: " The effects of climate change on river levels are noticeable through
    a higher occurrence of floods with disastrous social and economic impacts. As
    such, river level forecasting is essential in flood mitigation, infrastructure
    management and secure shipping. Historical records of river levels and influencing
    factors such as rainfall or soil conditions are used for predicting future river
    levels. The current state-of-the-art time-series prediction model is the LSTM
    network, a recurrent neural network. In this work we study the efficiency of convolutional
    models, and specifically the WaveNet model in forecasting one-day ahead river
    levels. We show that the additional benefit of the WaveNet model is the computational
    ease with which other input features can be included in the predictions of river
    stage and river flow. The conditional WaveNet models outperformed conditional
    LSTM models for river level prediction by capturing short-term, non-linear dependencies
    between input data. Furthermore, the Wavenet model offers a faster computation
    time, stable results and more possibilities for fine-tuning. "

- paper_title: Movement Tracks for the Automatic Detection of Fish Behavior in Videos
  abstract: Global warming is predicted to profoundly impact ocean ecosystems. Fish
    behavior is an important indicator of changes in such marine environments. Thus,
    the automatic identification of key fish behavior in videos represents a much
    needed tool for marine researchers, enabling them to study climate change-related
    phenomena. We offer a dataset of sablefish (Anoplopoma fimbria) startle behaviors
    in underwater videos, and investigate the use of deep learning (DL) methods for
    behavior detection on it. Our proposed detection system identifies fish instances
    using DL-based frameworks, determines trajectory tracks, derives novel behavior-specific
    features, and employs Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to identify startle
    behavior in sablefish. Its performance is studied by comparing it with a state-of-the-art
    DL-based video event detector.

- paper_title: 'Counting Cows: Tracking Illegal Cattle Ranching From High-Resolution
    Satellite Imagery'
  abstract: Cattle farming is responsible for 8.8\% of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.
    In addition to the methane emitted due to their digestive process, the growing
    need for grazing areas is an important driver of deforestation. While some regulations
    are in place for preserving the Amazon against deforestation, these are being
    flouted in various ways. Hence the need to scale and automate the monitoring of
    cattle ranching activities. Through a partnership with \textit{Anonymous under
    review}, we explore the feasibility of tracking and counting cattle at the continental
    scale from satellite imagery. With a license from Maxar Technologies, we obtained
    satellite imagery of the Amazon at 40cm resolution, and compiled a dataset of
    903 images containing a total of 28498 cattle. Our experiments show promising
    results and highlight important directions for the next steps on both counting
    algorithms and the data collection processes for solving such challenges.

- paper_title: 'RainBench: Enabling Data-Driven Precipitation Forecasting on a Global
    Scale'
  abstract: Climate change is expected to aggravate extreme precipitation events,
    directly impacting the livelihood of millions. Without a global precipitation
    forecasting system in place, many regions -- especially those constrained in resources
    to collect expensive groundstation data -- are left behind. To mitigate such unequal
    reach of climate change, a solution is to alleviate the reliance on numerical
    models (and by extension groundstation data) by enabling machine-learning-based
    global forecasts from satellite imagery. Though prior works exist in regional
    precipitation nowcasting, there lacks work in global, medium-term precipitation
    forecasting. Importantly, a common, accessible baseline for meaningful comparison
    is absent. In this work, we present RainBench, a multi-modal benchmark dataset
    dedicated to advancing global precipitation forecasting. We establish baseline
    tasks and release PyRain, a data-handling pipeline to enable efficient processing
    of decades-worth of data by any modeling framework. Whilst our work serves as
    a basis for a new chapter on global precipitation forecast from satellite imagery,
    the greater promise lies in the community joining forces to use our released datasets
    and tools in developing machine learning approaches to tackle this important challenge.

    Dynamics
  abstract: |-
    We develop physics-constrained and control-oriented predictive deep learning models for the thermal dynamics of a real-world commercial office building.
    The proposed method is based on the systematic encoding of physics-based prior knowledge into a structured recurrent neural architecture. Specifically, our model mimics the structure of the building thermal dynamics model and leverages penalty methods to model inequality constraints. Additionally, we use constrained matrix parameterization based on the Perron-Frobenius theorem to bound the eigenvalues of the learned network weights. We interpret the stable eigenvalues as dissipativeness of the learned building thermal model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a dataset obtained from an office building with 20 thermal zones.

- paper_title: Can Federated Learning Save The Planet ?
  abstract: Despite impressive results, deep learning-based technologies also raise
    severe privacy and environmental concerns induced by the training procedure often
    conducted in data centers. In response, alternatives to centralized training such
    as Federated Learning (FL) have emerged. Perhaps unexpectedly, FL in particular
    is starting to be deployed at a global scale by companies that must adhere to
    new legal demands and policies originating from governments and the civil society
    for privacy protection. \textit{However, the potential environmental impact related
    to FL remains unclear and unexplored. This paper offers the first-ever systematic
    study of the carbon footprint of FL.} First, we propose a rigorous model to quantify
    the carbon footprint, hence facilitating the investigation of the relationship
    between FL design and carbon emissions. Then, we compare the carbon footprint
    of FL to traditional centralized learning. Our findings show FL, despite being
    slower to converge, can be a greener technology than data center GPUs. Finally,
    we highlight and connect the reported results to the future challenges and trends
    in FL to reduce its environmental impact, including algorithms efficiency, hardware
    capabilities, and stronger industry transparency.

- paper_title: 'FireSRnet: Geoscience-driven super-resolution of future fire risk
    from climate change'
  abstract: With fires becoming increasingly frequent and severe across the globe
    in recent years, understanding climate change’s role in fire behavior is critical
    for quantifying current and future fire risk. However, global climate models typically
    simulate fire behavior at spatial scales too coarse for local risk assessments.
    Therefore, we propose a novel approach towards super-resolution (SR) enhancement
    of fire risk exposure maps that incorporates not only 2000 to 2020 monthly satellite
    observations of active fires but also local information on land cover and temperature.
    Inspired by SR architectures, we propose an efficient deep learning model trained
    for SR on fire risk exposure maps. We evaluate this model on resolution enhancement
    and find it outperforms standard image interpolation techniques at both 4x and
    8x enhancement while having comparable performance at 2x enhancement. We then
    demonstrate the generalizability of this SR model over northern California and
    New South Wales, Australia. We conclude with a discussion and application of our
    proposed model to climate model simulations of fire risk in 2040 and 2100, illustrating
    the potential for SR enhancement of fire risk maps from the latest state-of-the-art
    climate models.

    3D Building Data'
  abstract: While photovoltaic (PV) systems are installed at an unprecedented rate,
    reliable information on an installation level remains scarce. As a result, automatically
    created PV registries are a timely contribution to optimize grid planning and
    operations. This paper demonstrates how aerial imagery and three-dimensional building
    data can be combined to create an address-level PV registry, specifying area,
    tilt, and orientation angles. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach for
    PV capacity estimation. In addition, this work presents, for the first time, a
    comparison between automated and officially-created PV registries. Our results
    indicate that our enriched automated registry proves to be useful to validate,
    update, and complement official registries.

    A pilot study in Kigali, Rwanda'
  abstract: Estimating greenhouse gases from the Agriculture, Forestry and Other land
    Use (AFOLU) sector is very challenging partly due to the unavailability of data
    (particularly for land use and land use change sectors) and inadequate experts
    to analyze this data in case it is available. We used Collect Earth together with  Machine
    Learning techniques to be able to predict and classify all the land use types
    based on some few points collected using Collect Earth. We investigated the adoption
    of this tool and technology in Rwanda to help its national and sub-national inventories.
    The use of Collect Earth and the Machine Learning (ML) implementation will help
    Rwanda monitor and predict its Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry in a cost-effective
    manner whiles enhancing the quality of reports submitted to national and international
    bodies whiles introducing a new approach. Among the classification algorithms
    we tested, we had an overall  classification accuracy of 97% using the Classification
    and Regression Trees (CART) algorithm to to predict the six land Use classes across
    the country.

- paper_title: 'EarthNet2021: A novel large-scale dataset and challenge for forecasting
    localized climate impacts'
  abstract: Climate change is global, yet its concrete impacts can strongly vary between
    different locations in the same region. Seasonal weather forecasts currently operate
    at the mesoscale (> 1 km). For more targeted mitigation and adaptation, modelling
    impacts to < 100 m is needed. Yet, the relationship between driving variables
    and Earth’s surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current physical
    models. Large Earth observation datasets now enable us to create machine learning
    models capable of translating coarse weather information into high-resolution
    Earth surface forecasts encompassing localized climate impacts. Here, we define
    high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite imagery
    conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been tackled
    with deep learning models. Developing such models requires analysis-ready datasets.
    We introduce EarthNet2021, a new, curated dataset containing target spatio-temporal
    Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20 m resolution, matched with high-resolution
    topography and mesoscale (1.28 km) weather variables. With over 32000 samples
    it is suitable for training deep neural networks. Comparing multiple Earth surface
    forecasts is not trivial. Hence, we define the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking
    criterion for models forecasting Earth surface reflectance. For model intercomparison
    we frame EarthNet2021 as a challenge with four tracks based on different test
    sets. These allow evaluation of model validity and robustness as well as model
    applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In addition
    to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through satellite-derived vegetation
    indices, capable Earth surface models will enable downstream applications such
    as crop yield prediction, forest health assessments, coastline management, or
    biodiversity monitoring. Find data, code, and how to participate at www.earthnet.tech

    Planet'
  abstract: 'Accurate waste disposal, at the point of disposal, is crucial to fighting
    climate change. When materials that could be recycled or composted get diverted
    into landfills, they cause the emission of potent greenhouse gases such as methane.
    Current attempts to reduce erroneous waste disposal are expensive, inaccurate,
    and confusing. In this work, we propose DeepWaste, an easy-to-use mobile app,
    that utilizes highly optimized deep learning techniques to provide users instantaneous
    waste classification into trash, recycling, and compost. We experiment with several
    convolution neural network architectures to detect and classify waste items. Our
    best model, a deep learning residual neural network with 50 layers, achieves an
    average precision of 0.881 on the test set. We demonstrate the performance and
    efficiency of our app on a set of real-world images. '

- paper_title: 'Machine Learning Climate Model Dynamics: Offline versus Online Performance'
  abstract: Climate models are complicated software systems that approximate atmospheric
    and oceanic fluid mechanics at a coarse spatial resolution. Typical climate forecasts
    only explicitly resolve processes larger than 100 km and approximate any process
    occurring below this scale (e.g. thunderstorms) using so-called parametrizations.
    Machine learning could improve upon the accuracy of some traditional physical
    parametrizations by learning from so-called global cloud-resolving models. We
    compare the performance of two machine learning models, random forests (RF) and
    neural networks (NNs), at parametrizing the aggregate effect of moist physics
    in a 3 km resolution global simulation with an atmospheric model. The NN outperforms
    the RF when evaluated offline on a testing dataset. However, when the ML models
    are coupled to an atmospheric model run at 200 km resolution, the NN-assisted
    simulation crashes with 7 days, while the RF-assisted simulations remain stable.
    Both runs produce more accurate weather forecasts than a baseline configuration,
    but globally averaged climate variables drift over longer timescales.

- paper_title: 'OGNet: Towards a Global Oil and Gas Infrastructure Database using
    Deep Learning on Remotely Sensed Imagery'
  abstract: At least a quarter of the warming that the Earth is experiencing today
    is due to anthropogenic methane emissions.  There are multiple satellites in orbit
    and planned for launch in the next few years which can detect and quantify these
    emissions; however, to attribute methane emissions to their sources on the ground,
    a comprehensive database of the locations and characteristics of emission sources
    worldwide is essential.  In this work, we develop deep learning algorithms that
    leverage freely available high-resolution aerial imagery to automatically detect
    oil and gas infrastructure, one of the largest contributors to global methane
    emissions. We use the best algorithm, which we call OGNet, together with expert
    review to identify the locations of oil refineries and petroleum terminals in
    the U.S. We show that OGNet detects many facilities which are not present in four
    standard public datasets of oil and gas infrastructure. All detected facilities
    are associated with characteristics critical to quantifying and attributing methane
    emissions, including the types of infrastructure and number of storage tanks.
    The data curated and produced in this study is freely available at https://link/provided/in/camera/ready/version.

- paper_title: 'VConstruct: Filling Gaps in Chl-a Data Using a Variational Autoencoder'
  abstract: |-
    Remote sensing of Chlorophyll-a is vital in monitoring climate change. Chlorphylla measurements give us an idea of the algae concentrations in the ocean, which
    lets us monitor ocean health. However, a common problem is that the satellites
    used to gather the data are commonly obstructed by clouds and other artifacts.
    This means that time series data from satellites can suffer from spatial data loss.
    There are a number of algorithms that are able to reconstruct the missing parts of
    these images to varying degrees of accuracy, with Data INterpolating Empirical
    Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) being the current standard. However, DINEOF
    is slow, suffers from accuracy loss in temporally homogenous waters, reliant on
    temporal data, and only able to generate a single potential reconstruction. We
    propose a machine learning approach to reconstruction of Chlorophyll-a data using
    a Variational Autoencoder (VAE). Our accuracy results to date are competitive
    with but slightly less accurate than DINEOF. We show the benefits of our method
    including vastly decreased computation time and ability to generate multiple potential reconstructions. Lastly, we outline our planned improvements and future
    work.

- paper_title: A Comparison of Data-Driven Models for Predicting Stream Water Temperature
  abstract: 'Changes to the Earth''s climate are expected to negatively impact water
    resources in the future. It is important to have  accurate modelling of river
    flow and water quality to make optimal decisions for water management. Machine
    learning and deep learning models have become promising methods for making such
    hydrological predictions. Using these models, however, requires careful consideration
    both of data constraints and of model complexity for a given problem. Here, we
    use machine learning (ML) models to predict monthly stream water temperature records
    at three  monitoring locations in the Northwestern United States with long-term
    datasets, using meteorological data as predictors. We fit three ML models: a Multiple
    Linear Regression, a Random Forest Regression, and a Support Vector Regression,
    and compare them against two baseline models: a persistence model and historical
    model. We show that all three ML models are reasonably able to predict mean monthly
    stream temperatures with root mean-squared errors (RMSE) ranging from 0.63-0.91
    degrees Celsius. Of the three ML models, Support Vector Regression performs the
    best with an error of 0.63-0.75 degrees Celsius. However, all models perform poorly
    on extreme values of water temperature. We identify the need for machine learning
    approaches for predicting extreme values for variables such as water temperature,
    since it has significant implications for stream ecosystems and biota. '

- paper_title: Automated Salmonid Counting in Sonar Data
  abstract: The prosperity of salmonids is crucial for several ecological and economic
    functions. Accurately counting spawning salmonids during their seasonal migration
    is essential in monitoring threatened populations, assessing the efficacy of recovery
    strategies, guiding fishing season regulations, and supporting the management
    of commercial and recreational fisheries. While several different methods exist
    for counting river fish, they all rely heavily on human involvement, introducing
    a hefty financial and time burden. In this paper we present an automated fish
    counting method that utilizes data captured from ARIS sonar cameras to detect
    and track salmonids migrating in rivers. Our results show that our fully automated
    system has a 19.3% per-clip error when compared to human counting performance.
    There is room to improve, but our system can already decrease the amount of time
    field biologists and fishery managers need to spend manually watching ARIS clips.

    learning from an imbalanced sky images dataset via sampling and data augmentation'
  abstract: Integrating photovoltaics (PV) into electricity grids is one of the major
    pathways towards a low-carbon energy system. However, the biggest challenge is
    the strong fluctuation in PV power generation. In recent years, sky-image-based
    PV output prediction using deep neural networks has emerged as a promising approach
    to alleviate the uncertainty. Despite the research surge in exploring different
    model architectures, there is currently no study addressing the issue of learning
    from an imbalanced sky images dataset, the outcome of which would be highly beneficial
    for improving the reliability of existing and new solar forecasting models. In
    this study, we train convolutional neural network (CNN) models from an imbalanced
    sky images dataset for two disparate PV output prediction tasks, i.e., nowcast
    and forecast. We empirically examine the efficacy of using different sampling
    and data augmentation approaches to create synthesized dataset for model development.
    We further apply a three-stage selection approach to determine the optimal sampling
    approach, data augmentation technique and oversampling rate.

    Response'
  abstract: 'Energy Demand Response (DR) will play a crucial role in balancing renewable
    energy generation with demand as grids decarbonize. There is growing interest
    in developing Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques to optimize DR pricing, as
    pricing set by electric utilities often cannot take behavioral irrationality into
    account. However, so far, attempts to standardize RL efforts in this area do not
    exist. In this paper, we present a first of the kind OpenAI gym environment for
    testing DR with occupant level building dynamics. We demonstrate the variety of
    parameters built into our office environment allowing the researcher to customize
    a building to meet their specifications of interest. We hope that this work enables
    future work in DR in buildings. '

- paper_title: Machine Learning for Glacier Monitoring in the Hindu Kush Himalaya
  abstract: Glacier mapping is key to ecological monitoring in the Hindu Kush Himalaya
    region. Climate change poses a risk to individuals whose livelihoods depend on
    the health of glacier ecosystems. In this work, we present a machine learning
    based approach to support ecological monitoring, with a focus on glaciers. Our
    approach is based on semi-automated mapping from satellite images. We utilize
    readily available remote sensing data to create a model to identify and outline
    both clean ice and debris-covered glaciers from satellite imagery. We also release
    data and develop a web tool that allows experts to visualize and correct model
    predictions, with the ultimate aim of accelerating the glacier mapping process.

- paper_title: Data-driven modeling of cooling demand in a commercial building
  abstract: Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems account for
    30% of the total energy consumption in buildings. Design and implementation of
    energy-efficient schemes can play a pivotal role in minimizing energy usage. As
    an important first step towards improved HVAC system controls, this study proposes
    a new framework for modeling the thermal response of buildings by leveraging data
    measurements and formulating a data-driven system identification model. The proposed
    method combines principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the most significant
    predictors that influence the cooling demand of a building with an auto-regressive
    integrated moving average with exogenous variables (ARIMAX) model. The performance
    of the developed model was evaluated both analytically and visually. It was found
    that our PCA-based ARIMAX (2-0-5) model was able to accurately forecast the cooling
    demand for the prediction horizon of 7 days. In this work, the actual measurements
    from a university campus building are used for model development and validation.

  abstract: 'In an effort to provide optimal inputs to downstream modeling systems
    (e.g., a hydrodynamics model that simulates the water circulation of a lake),
    we hereby strive to enhance resolution of precipitation fields from a weather

    generative adversarial networks (ESRGAN) proposed in 2017, and the content adaptive
    resampler (CAR) proposed in 2020. Both models outperform simple bicubic interpolation,

- paper_title: 'Emerging Trends of Sustainability Reporting in the ICT Industry: Insights
    from Discriminative Topic Mining'
  abstract: The Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) industry has a considerable
    climate change impact and accounts for approximately 3 percent of global carbon
    emissions. Despite the increasing availability of sustainability reports provided
    by ICT companies, we still lack a systematic understanding of what has been disclosed
    at an industry level. In this paper, we make the first major effort to use modern
    unsupervised learning  methods to investigate the sustainability reporting themes
    and trends of the ICT industry over the past two decades. We build a cross-sector
    dataset containing 22,534 environmental reports from 1999 to 2019, of which 2,187
    are ICT specific. We then apply CatE, a text embedding based topic modeling method,
    to mine specific keywords that ICT companies use to report on climate change and
    energy. As a result, we identify (1) important shifts in ICT companies' climate
    change narratives from physical metrics towards climate-related disasters, (2)
    key organizations with large influence on ICT companies, and (3) ICT companies'
    increasing focus on data center and server energy efficiency.

- paper_title: Loosely Conditioned Emulation of Global Climate Models With Generative
    Adversarial Networks
  abstract: 'Climate models encapsulate our best understanding of the Earth system,
    allowing research to be conducted on its future under alternative assumptions
    of how human-driven climate forces are going to evolve. An important application
    of climate models is to provide metrics of mean and extreme climate changes, particularly
    under these alternative future scenarios, as these quantities drive the impacts
    of climate on society and natural systems. Because of the need to explore a wide
    range of alternative scenarios and other sources of uncertainties in a computationally
    efficient manner, climate models can only take us so far, as they require significant
    computational resources, especially when attempting to characterize extreme events,
    which are rare and thus demand long and numerous simulations in order to accurately
    represent their changing statistics. Here we use deep learning in a proof of concept
    that lays the foundation for emulating global climate model output for different
    scenarios.  We train two "loosely conditioned" Generative Adversarial Networks
    (GANs) that emulate daily precipitation output from a fully coupled Earth system
    model: one GAN modeling Fall-Winter behavior and the other Spring-Summer. Our
    GANs are trained to produce spatiotemporal samples: 32 days of precipitation over
    a 64x128 regular grid discretizing the globe. We evaluate the generator with a
    set of related performance metrics based upon KL divergence, and find the generated
    samples to be nearly as well matched to the test data as the validation data is
    to test. We also find the generated samples to accurately estimate the mean number
    of dry days and mean longest dry spell in the 32 day samples. Our trained GANs
    can rapidly generate numerous realizations at a vastly reduced computational expense,
    compared to large ensembles of climate models, which greatly aids in estimating
    the statistics of extreme events.'

    species. Besides, the proposal includes a background removal algorithm to feed
    a fine-tuned CNN. We evaluate the quantitative (accuracy metric) and qualitative

    show a 96.64 % training accuracy and 96.52 % testing accuracy on the VGG-19 model.
    Furthermore, the visual interpretation of the model evidences that leaf venations
    have the highest correlation in the plant recognition task.

  abstract: 'Understanding the changing distributions of butterflies gives insight
    into the impacts of climate change across ecosystems and is a prerequisite for
    conservation efforts. eButterfly is a citizen science website created to allow
    people to track the butterfly species around them and use these observations to
    contribute to research. However, correctly identifying butterfly species is a
    challenging task for non-specialists and currently requires the involvement of
    entomologists to verify the labels of novice users on the website. We have developed
    a computer vision model to label butterfly images from eButterfly automatically,
    decreasing the need for human experts. We employ a model that incorporates geographic
    and temporal information of where and when the image was taken, in addition to
    the image itself. We show that we can successfully apply this spatiotemporal model
    for fine-grained image recognition, significantly improving the accuracy of our
    classification model compared to a baseline image recognition system trained on
    the same dataset. '

- paper_title: High-resolution global irrigation prediction with Sentinel-2 30m data
  abstract: An accurate and precise understanding of global irrigation usage is crucial
    for a variety of climate science efforts. Irrigation is highly energy-intensive,
    and as population growth continues at its current pace, increases in crop need
    and water usage will have an impact on climate change.  Precise irrigation data
    can help with monitoring water usage and optimizing agricultural yield, particularly
    in developing countries. Irrigation data, in tandem with precipitation data, can
    be used to predict water budgets as well as climate and weather modeling. With
    our research, we produce an irrigation prediction model that combines unsupervised
    clustering of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) temporal signatures
    with a precipitation heuristic to label the months that irrigation peaks for each
    cropland cluster in a given year. We have developed a novel irrigation model and
    Python package ("Irrigation30") to generate 30m resolution irrigation predictions
    of cropland worldwide. With a small crowdsourced test set of cropland coordinates
    and irrigation labels, using a fraction of the resources used by the state-of-the-art
    NASA-funded GFSAD30 project with irrigation data limited to India and Australia,
    our model was able to achieve consistency scores in excess of 97% and an accuracy
    of 92% in a small geo-diverse randomly sampled test set.

    Analyzing Clusters in Energy Social Games
  abstract: Energy use in buildings account for approximately half of global electricity
    consumption and a significant amount of CO2 emissions. To encourage energy efficient
    behavior among occupants in a building, energy social games have emerged to be
    a successful strategy leveraging human-in-the-loop strategy and engaging users
    in a competitive game with incentives for energy efficient behavior. Prior works
    involve an incentive design mechanism which is dependent on knowledge of utility
    functions (energy use behavior) for the users, which is hard to compute when the
    number of users is high, common in buildings. We propose that the utilities can
    be grouped to a relatively small number of clusters, which can then be targeted
    with tailored incentives. Proposed work performs the above segmentation by learning
    the features leading to human decision making towards energy usage in competitive
    environment. We propose a graphical lasso based approach with explainable nature
    for such segmentation, by studying the feature correlations in a real-world energy
    social game dataset.

    for Out-of-Distribution Robustness'
  abstract: |-
    Many machine learning applications used to tackle climate change involve lots
    of unlabeled data (such as satellite imagery) along with auxiliary information
    such as climate data. In this work, we show how to use auxiliary information in
    a semi-supervised setting to improve both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
    (OOD) accuracies (e.g. for countries in Africa where we have very little labeled
    data). We show that 1) on real-world datasets, the common practice of using
    auxiliary information as additional input features improves in-distribution error but
    can hurt OOD. Oppositely, we find that 2) using auxiliary information as outputs of
    auxiliary tasks to pre-train a model improves OOD error. 3) To get the best of both
    worlds, we introduce In-N-Out, which first trains a model with auxiliary inputs and
    uses it to pseudolabel all the in-distribution inputs, then pre-trains a model on OOD
    auxiliary outputs and fine-tunes this model with the pseudolabels (self-training). We
    show both theoretically and empirically on remote sensing datasets for land cover
    prediction and cropland prediction that In-N-Out outperforms auxiliary inputs or
    outputs alone on both in-distribution and OOD error.

    dataset for verification of climate change-related claims. By providing a dataset
    for the research community, we aim to help and encourage work on improving algorithms
    for retrieving climate-specific information and detecting fake news in social
    and mass media to reduce the impact of misinformation on the formation of public
    opinion on climate change. We adapt the methodology of \textsc{fever} \cite{thorne2018fever},
    the largest dataset of artificially designed claims, to real-life claims collected
    from the Internet. Although during this process, we could count on the support
    of renowned climate scientists, it turned out to be no easy task. We discuss the
    surprising, subtle complexity of modeling real-world climate-related claims within
    the \textsc{fever} framework, which provides a valuable challenge for general
    natural language understanding. We hope that our work will mark the beginning
    of an exciting long-term joint effort by the climate science and \textsc{ai} community
    to develop robust algorithms to verify the facts for climate-related claims. '

- paper_title: Understanding global fire regimes using Artificial Intelligence
  abstract: Improved understanding of fire activity and its influencing factors will
    impact the way we interact and coexist with not only the fire itself but also
    with the ecosystem as a whole. We consolidate more than 20 million wildfire records
    between 2000 and 2018 across the six continents. This data is processed with artificial
    intelligence methods to discover global fire regimes, areas with characteristic
    fire behavior over long periods. We discover 15 groups with clear differences
    in fire-related historical behavior. Despite sharing historical fire behavior,
    regions belonging to the same group present significant differences in location
    and influencing factors. Groups are further divided into 62 regimes based on spatial
    aggregation patterns, providing a comprehensive characterization. This allows
    an interpretation of how a combination of vegetation, climate, and demographic
    features results in a specific fire regime. The current work expands on existing
    classification efforts and is a step forward in addressing the complex challenge
    of characterizing global fire regimes.

- paper_title: 'ClimaText: A Dataset for Climate Change Topic Detection'
  abstract: |-
    Climate change communication in the mass media and other textual sources may affect and shape public perception. Extracting climate change information from these sources is an important task, e.g., for filtering content and e-discovery, sentiment analysis, automatic summarization, question-answering, and fact-checking. However, automating this process is a challenge, as climate change is a complex, fast-moving, and often ambiguous topic with scarce resources for popular text-based AI tasks. In this paper, we introduce \textsc{ClimaText}, a dataset for sentence-based climate change topic detection, which we make publicly available. We explore different approaches to identify the climate change topic in various text sources. We find that popular keyword-based models are not adequate for such a complex and evolving task. Context-based algorithms like BERT~\cite{devlin2018bert} can detect, in addition to many trivial cases, a variety of complex and implicit topic patterns. Nevertheless, our analysis reveals a great potential for improvement in several directions, such as, e.g., capturing the discussion on indirect effects of climate change. Hence,
    we hope this work can serve as a good starting point for further research on this topic.

- paper_title: Towards Data-Driven Physics-Informed Global Precipitation Forecasting
    from Satellite Imagery
  abstract: "Under the effects of global warming, extreme events such as floods and
    droughts are increasing in frequency and intensity.\nThis trend directly affects
    communities and make all the more urgent widening the access to accurate precipitation
    forecasting systems for disaster preparedness.\nNowadays, weather forecasting
    relies on numerical models necessitating massive computing resources that most
    developing countries cannot afford.  \nMachine learning approaches are still in
    their infancy but already show the promise for democratizing weather predictions,
    by leveraging any data source and requiring less compute.\nIn this work, we propose
    a methodology for data-driven and physics-aware global precipitation forecasting
    from satellite imagery. \nTo fully take advantage of the available data, we design
    the system as three elements:\n1. The atmospheric state is estimated from recent
    satellite data. \n2. The atmospheric state is propagated forward in time. \n3.
    The atmospheric state is used to derive the precipitation intensity within a nearby
    time interval. In particular, our use of stochastic methods for forecasting the
    atmospheric state represents a novel application in this domain."

- paper_title: A Generative Adversarial Gated Recurrent Network for Power Disaggregation
    & Consumption Awareness
  abstract: " Separating the household aggregated power signal into its additive sub-components
    is called energy (power) disaggregation or Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring. NILM
    can play an instrumental role as a driver towards consumer energy consumption
    awareness and behavioral change.  In this paper, we propose EnerGAN++, a model
    based on GANs for robust energy disaggregation. We propose a unified autoencoder
    (AE) and GAN architecture, in which the AE achieves a non-linear power signal
    source separation. The discriminator performs sequence classification, using a
    recurrent CNN to handle the temporal dynamics of an appliance energy consumption
    time series. Experimental results indicate the proposed method’s superiority compared
    to the current state of the art."

- paper_title: 'Deep Fire Topology: Understanding the role of landscape spatial patterns
    in wildfire susceptibility'
  abstract: Increasing wildfire activity across the globe has become an urgent issue
    with enormous ecological and social impacts. While there is evidence that landscape
    topology affects fire growth, no study has yet reported its potential influence
    on fire ignition. This study proposes a deep learning framework focused on understanding
    the impact of different landscape topologies on the ignition of a wildfire and
    the rationale behind these results. Our model achieves an accuracy of above 90\%
    in fire occurrence prediction, detection, and classification of risky areas by
    only exploiting topological pattern information from 17,579 landscapes. This study
    reveals the strong potential of landscape topology in wildfire occurrence prediction
    and its implications for similar research. The proposed methodology can be applied
    to multiple fields/studies to understand and capture the role and impact of different
    topological features and their interactions.

- paper_title: Interpretability in Convolutional Neural Networks for Building Damage
    Classification in Satellite Imagery
  abstract: Natural disasters ravage the world's cities, valleys, and shores on a
    monthly basis. Having precise and efficient mechanisms for assessing infrastructure
    damage is essential to channel resources and minimize the loss of life. Using
    a dataset that includes labeled pre- and post- disaster satellite imagery, we
    train multiple convolutional neural networks to assess building damage on a per-building
    basis. In order to investigate how to best classify building damage, we present
    a highly interpretable deep-learning methodology that seeks to explicitly convey
    the most useful information required to train an accurate classification model.
    We also delve into which loss functions best optimize these models. Our findings
    include that ordinal-cross entropy loss is the most optimal loss function to use
    and that including the type of disaster that caused the damage in combination
    with a pre- and post-disaster image best predicts the level of damage caused.
    Our research seeks to computationally contribute to aiding in this ongoing and
    growing humanitarian crisis, heightened by climate change.

- paper_title: Long-Range Seasonal Forecasting of 2m-Temperature with Machine Learning
  abstract: A significant challenge in seasonal climate prediction is whether a prediction
    can beat climatology. We hereby present results from two data-driven models -
    a convolutional (CNN) and a recurrent (RNN) neural network - that predict 2m temperature
    out to 52 weeks for six geographically-diverse locations. The motivation for testing
    the two classes of ML models is to allow the CNN to leverage information related
    to teleconnections and the RNN to leverage long-term historical temporal signals.
    The ML models boast improved accuracy of long-range temperature forecasts up to
    a lead time of 30 weeks for PCC and up 52 weeks for RMSESS, however only for select
    locations. Further iteration is required to ensure the ML models have value beyond
    regions where the climatology has a noticeably reduced correlation skill, namely
    the tropics.

- paper_title: 'Explaining Complex Energy Systems: A Challenge'
  abstract: Designing future low-carbon, sector-coupled energy systems is a complex
    task. The work is therefore often supported by software tools that model and optimize
    possible energy systems. These tools typically have high dimensional inputs and
    outputs and are tailored towards domain experts. The final investment decisions
    to implement a certain system, however, are mostly made by people with little
    time and prior knowledge, thus unable to understand models and their input data
    used in these tools. Since such decisions are often connected to significant personal
    consequences for the decision makers, it is not enough for them to rely on experts
    only. They need an own, at least rough understanding. Explaining the key rationales
    behind complex energy system designs to non-expert decision makers in a short
    amount of time is thus a critical task for realizing projects of the energy transition
    in practice. It is also an interesting, novel challenge for the explainable AI
    community.

- paper_title: 'The Human Effect Requires Affect: Addressing Social-Psychological
    Factors of Climate Change with Machine Learning'
  abstract: Machine learning has the potential to aid in mitigating the human effects
    of climate change. Previous applications of machine learning to tackle the human
    effects in climate change include approaches like informing individuals of their
    carbon footprint and strategies to reduce it. For these methods to be the most
    effective they must consider relevant social-psychological factors for each individual.
    Of social-psychological factors at play in climate change, affect has been previously
    identified as a key element in perceptions and willingness to engage in mitigative
    behaviours. In this work, we propose an investigation into how affect could be
    incorporated to enhance machine learning based interventions for climate change.
    We propose using affective agent-based modelling for climate change as well as
    the use of a simulated climate change social dilemma to explore the potential
    benefits of affective machine learning interventions. Behavioural and informational
    interventions can be a powerful tool in helping humans adopt mitigative behaviours.
    We expect that utilizing affective ML can make interventions an even more powerful
    tool and help mitigative behaviours become widely adopted.

    using Machine Learning'
  abstract: Despite being the most carbon-efficient way of transportation, shipping
    is an important contributor to air pollution especially in coastal areas. The
    sector’s impact on the environment still need mitigation, through different measures
    undertaken so far. Operational optimization of ports and ships is a step in shipping
    progress towards reducing the pollution. The main purpose of this research is
    to reduce the degree of error and uncertainty of some operational parameters using
    Machine Learning models, and provide port managers with accurate information to
    assist them in their decision-making process. Therefore, they will be able to
    manage ships speed and port times for a better monitoring of ships emissions during
    sea voyage and port stay.

- paper_title: Privacy Preserving Demand Forecasting to Encourage Consumer Acceptance
    of Smart Energy Meters
  abstract: In this proposal paper we highlight the need for privacy preserving energy
    demand forecasting to allay a major concern consumers have about smart meter installations.
    High resolution smart meter data can expose many private aspects of a consumer’s
    household such as occupancy, habits and individual appliance usage. Yet smart
    metering infrastructure has the potential to vastly reduce carbon emissions from
    the energy sector through improved operating efficiencies. We propose the application
    of a distributed machine learning setting known as federated learning for energy
    demand forecasting at various scales to make load prediction possible whilst retaining
    the privacy of consumers’ raw energy consumption data.

- paper_title: Leveraging Machine learning for  Sustainable and Self-sufficient Energy
    Communities
  abstract: Community Energies (CEs) are the next-generation energy management techniques
    that empowers citizens to interact with the energy market as self-consumers or
    prosumers actively. Successful implementation of CEs will promote sustainable
    energy production and consumption practices; thus, contributing to affordable
    and clean energy (SDG7) and climate action (SDG 13). Despite the potential of
    CEs, managing the overall power production and demand is challenging. This is
    because power is generated, distributed and controlled by several producers, each
    of which with different, and potentially conflicting, objectives. Thus, this project
    will investigate the role of machine learning approaches in smartening CEs, increasing
    energy awareness and enabling distributed energy resources planning and management.
    The project implementation will be centered around proof of concept development
    and capacity development in Africa.

- paper_title: 'Structural Forecasting for Tropical Cyclone Intensity Prediction:
    Providing Insight with Deep Learning'
  abstract: 'Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity forecasts are ultimately issued by human
    forecasters. The human in-the-loop pipeline requires that any forecasting guidance
    must be easily digestible by TC experts if it is to be adopted at operational
    centers like the National Hurricane Center. Our proposed framework leverages deep
    learning to provide forecasters with something neither end-to-end prediction models
    nor traditional intensity guidance does: a powerful tool for monitoring high-dimensional
    time series of key physically relevant predictors and the means to understand
    how the predictors relate to one another and to short-term intensity changes.'

- paper_title: Hyperspectral Remote Sensing of Aquatic Microbes to Support Water Resource
    Management
  abstract: Harmful algal blooms in drinking water supply and at recreational sites
    endanger human health. Excessive algal growth can result in low oxygen environments,
    making them uninhabitable for fish and other aquatic life. Harmful algae and algal
    blooms are predicted to increase in frequency and extent due to the warming climate,
    but microbial dynamics remain difficult to predict. Existing satellite remote
    sensing monitoring technologies are ill-equipped to discriminate harmful algae,
    while models do not adequately capture the complex controls on algal populations.
    This proposal explores the potential for Bayesian neural networks to detect phytoplankton
    pigments from hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance retrievals. Once developed,
    such a model could enable hyperspectral remote sensing retrievals to support decision
    making in water resource management as more advanced ocean color satellites are
    launched in the coming decade. While uncertainty quantification motivates the
    proposed use of Bayesian models, the interpretation of these uncertainties in
    an operational context must be carefully considered.

- paper_title: 'Wildfire Smoke and Air Quality: How Machine Learning Can Guide Forest
    Management'
  abstract: Prescribed burns are currently the most effective method of reducing the
    risk of widespread wildfires, but a largely missing component in forest management
    is knowing which fuels one can safely burn to minimize exposure to toxic smoke.
    Here we show how machine learning, such as spectral clustering and manifold learning,
    can provide interpretable representations and powerful tools for differentiating
    between smoke types, hence providing forest managers with vital information on
    effective strategies to reduce climate-induced wildfires while minimizing production
    of harmful smoke.

- paper_title: 'HECT: High-Dimensional Ensemble Consistency Testing for Climate Models'
  abstract: Climate models play a crucial role in understanding the effect of environmental
    and man-made changes on climate to help mitigate climate risks and inform governmental
    decisions. Large global climate models such as the Community Earth System Model
    (CESM), developed by the National Center for Atmospheric Research, are very complex
    with millions of lines of code describing interactions of the atmosphere, land,
    oceans, and ice, among other components. As development of the CESM is constantly
    ongoing, simulation outputs need to be continuously controlled for quality. To
    be able to distinguish a ``climate-changing'' modification of the code base from
    a true climate-changing physical process or intervention, there needs to be a
    principled way of assessing statistical reproducibility that can handle both spatial
    and temporal high-dimensional simulation outputs. Our proposed work uses probabilistic
    classifiers like tree-based algorithms and deep neural networks to perform a statistically
    rigorous goodness-of-fit test of high-dimensional spatio-temporal data.

- paper_title: 'Towards DeepSentinel: An extensible corpus of labelled Sentinel-1
    and -2 imagery and a proposed general purpose sensor-fusion semantic embedding
    model'
  abstract: Earth observation offers new insight into anthropogenic changes to nature,
    and how these changes are effecting (and are effected by) the built environment
    and the real economy. With the global availability of medium-resolution (10-30m)
    synthetic aperature radar (SAR) Sentinel-1 and multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery,
    machine learning can be employed to offer these insights at scale, unbiased to
    company- and country-level reporting. In this proposal, we document the development
    of an extensible corpus of labelled and unlabelled Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery
    for the purposes of sensor fusion research. We make a large corpus and supporting
    code publicly available. We propose our own experiment design for the development
    of \emph{DeepSentinel}, a general-purpose semantic embedding model. Our aspiration
    is to provide pretrained models for transfer learning applications, significantly
    accelerating the impact of machine learning-enhanced earth observation on climate
    change mitigation.

- paper_title: Monitoring Shorelines via High-Resolution Satellite Imagery and Deep
    Learning
  abstract: Twentieth-century has seen an overall sea-level rise of 0.5m [7, 11] and
    the studies for the twenty-first-century project the overall increment within
    a range of 0.5m to 2m, considering high emission scenarios and rapid melting of
    major Antarctic glaciers. Naturally, this has a severe impact on a major percentage
    of the population inhabiting coastal land zones], with a recent study placing
    110million people living below the local high tide line. Of all the different
    coastline types, sandy shores, forming 31% of the world’s beaches, undergo major
    erosion and accretion changes and hence are of special focus in this paper. Because
    of these reasons, it is paramount to regularly monitor the coastline changes across
    the world for better understanding and to create necessary preparation and mitigation
    strategies.

- paper_title: Graph Neural Networks for Improved El Niño Forecasting
  abstract: |-
    Deep learning-based models have recently outperformed state-of-the-art seasonal forecasting models, such as for predicting El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, current deep learning models are based on convolutional neural networks which are difficult to interpret and can fail to model large-scale atmospheric patterns called teleconnections. Hence, we propose the application of spatiotemporal Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to forecast ENSO at long lead times, finer granularity and improved predictive skill than current state-of-the-art methods.
    The explicit modeling of information flow via edges may also allow for more interpretable forecasts.
    Preliminary results are promising and outperform state-of-the art systems for projections 1 and 3 months ahead.

- paper_title: Residue Density Segmentation for Monitoring and Optimizing Tillage
    Practices
  abstract: '"No-till" and cover cropping are often identified as the leading simple,
    best management practices for carbon sequestration in agriculture.  However, the
    root of the problem is more complex, with the potential benefits of these approaches
    depending on numerous factors including a field''s soil type(s), topography, and
    management history.  Instead of using computer vision approaches to simply classify
    a field as till vs. no-till, we instead seek to identify the degree of residue
    coverage across a field through a probabilistic deep learning segmentation approach
    to enable more accurate analysis of carbon holding potential and realization.
    This approach will not only provide more precise insights into currently implemented
    practices, but also enable a more accurate identification process of fields with
    the greatest potential for adopting new practices to significantly impact carbon
    sequestration in agriculture. '

- paper_title: Machine Learning Informed Policy for Environmental Justice in Atlanta
    with Climate Justice Implications
  abstract: Environmental hazards are not evenly distributed between the privileged
    and the protected classes in the U.S.  Neighborhood zoning and planning of hazardous
    treatment, storage, and disposal facilities (TSDs) play a significant role in
    this sanctioned environmental racism. TSDs and toxic chemical releases into the
    air are accounted for by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Toxic
    Release Inventories (TRIs) [2,4,7, 14]. TSDs and toxic chemical releases not only
    emit carbon dioxide and methane, which are the top two drivers of climate change,
    but also emit contaminants, such as arsenic, lead, and mercury into the water,
    air, and crops [12]. Studies on spatial disparities in TRIs and TSDs based on
    race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status (SES) in U.S. cities, such as Charleston,
    SC, San Joaquin Valley, CA, and West Oakland, CA showed that there are more TRIs
    and TSDs in non-white and low SES areas in those cities [2,4,7]. Environmental
    justice recognizes that the impacts of environmental burdens, such as socioeconomic
    and public health outcomes, are not equitably distributed, and in fact bear the
    heaviest burden on marginalized people, including communities of color and low-income
    communities [12]. In our case, environmental justice has a strong tie to climate
    justice since the TRIs release carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere.

    in Agriculture
  abstract: The impact of climate change on tropical agri-food systems will depend
    on both the direction and magnitude of climate change, and the agricultural sector’s
    adaptive capacity, the latter being affected by the chosen adaptation strategies.
    By extending SEIRS, a Satellite Remote Sensing (SRS) based system originally developed
    by the International Center for Tropical Agriculture - CIAT for monitoring U.S.
    Government-funded development programs across cropping areas in Africa, this research
    proposes the development and deployment of a scalable AI-based platform exploiting
    free-of-charge SRS data that will enable the agri-food sector to monitor a wide
    range of climate change adaptation (CCA) interventions in a timely, evidence-driven
    and comparable manner. The main contributions of the platform are i) ingesting
    and processing variety sources of SRS data with a considerable record (> 5 years)
    of vegetation greenness and precipitation (input data); ii) operating an end-to-end
    system by exploiting AI-based models suited to time series analysis such as Seq2Seq
    and Transformers; iii) providing customised proxies informing the success or failure
    of a given local CCA intervention(s).

    Technology in Wildfire Intelligence
  abstract: With the advent of climate change, wildfires are becoming more frequent
    and severe across several regions worldwide. To prevent and mitigate its effects,
    wildfire intelligence plays a pivotal role, e.g. to monitor the evolution of wildfires
    and for early detection in high-risk areas such as wildland-urban-interface regions.
    Recent works have proposed deep learning solutions for fire detection tasks, however
    the current limited databases prevent reliable real-world deployments. We propose
    the development of expert-in-the-loop systems that combine the benefits of semi-automated
    data annotation with relevant domain knowledge expertise. Through this approach
    we aim to improve the data curation process and contribute to the generation of
    large-scale image databases for relevant wildfire tasks and empower the application
    of machine learning techniques in wildfire intelligence in real scenarios.

- paper_title: 'ACED: Accelerated Computational Electrochemical systems Discovery'
  abstract: Large-scale electrification is vital to addressing the climate crisis,
    but many engineering challenges remain to fully electrifying both the chemical
    industry and transportation. In both of these areas, new electrochemical materials
    and systems will be critical, but developing these systems currently relies heavily
    on computationally expensive first-principles simulations as well as human-time-intensive
    experimental trial and error. We propose to develop an automated workflow that
    accelerates these computational steps by introducing both automated error handling
    in generating the first-principles training data as well as physics-informed machine
    learning surrogates to further reduce computational cost. It will also have the
    capacity to include automated experiments ``in the loop'' in order to dramatically
    accelerate the overall materials discovery pipeline.

- paper_title: Forecasting Marginal Emissions Factors in PJM
  abstract: Many climate change applications rely on accurate forecasts of power grid
    emissions, but many forecasting methods can be expensive, sensitive to input errors,
    or lacking in domain knowledge. Motivated by initial experiments using deep learning
    and power system modeling techniques, we propose a method that combines the strengths
    of both of these approaches to forecast hourly day-ahead MEFs for the PJM region
    of the United States.

- paper_title: Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Modeling for Understanding
    the Oceans and Climate Change
  abstract: |-
    These changes will have a drastic impact on almost all forms of life in the ocean with further consequences on food security, ecosystem services in coastal and inland communities. Despite these impacts, scientific data and infrastructures are still lacking to understand and quantify the consequences of these perturbations on the marine ecosystem.

    Understanding this phenomenon is not only an urgent but also a scientifically demanding task. Consequently, it is a problem that must be addressed with a scientific cohort approach, where multi-disciplinary teams collaborate to bring the best of different scientific areas.

    In this proposal paper, we describe our newly launched four-years project focused on developing new artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mathematical modeling tools to contribute to the understanding of the structure, functioning, and underlying mechanisms and dynamics of the global ocean symbiome and its relation with climate change. These actions should enable the understanding of our oceans and predict and mitigate the consequences of climate change.

- paper_title: Machine Learning towards a Global Parameterisation of Atmospheric New
    Particle Formation and Growth
  abstract: "  New particle formation (NPF) and growth in the atmosphere affects climate,
    weather, air quality, and human health. It is the first step of the complex process
    leading to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) formation. Even though there is a wealth
    of observations from field measurements (in forests, high-altitude, polar regions,
    coastal and urban sites, aircraft campaigns), as well as laboratory studies of
    multi-component nucleation (including the CLOUD chamber at CERN), and improved
    nucleation theories, the NPF parameterisations in regional and global models are
    lacking. These deficiencies make the impacts of aerosols one of the highest sources
    of uncertainty in global climate change modelling, and associated impacts on weather
    and human health. We propose to use Machine Learning methods to overcome the challenges
    in modelling aerosol nucleation and growth, by ingesting the data from the multitude
    of available sources to create a single parameterisation applicable throughout
    the modelled atmosphere (troposphere and stratosphere at all latitudes) that efficiently
    encompasses all input ambient conditions and concentrations of relevant species."
