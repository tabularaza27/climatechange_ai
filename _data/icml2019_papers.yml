  paper_title: Policy Search with Non-uniform State Representations for Environmental
    Sampling
  abstract: Surveying fragile ecosystems like coral reefs is important to monitor
    the effects of climate change. We present an adaptive sampling technique that  generates
    efficient trajectories covering hotspots in the region of interest at a high rate.
    A key feature of our sampling algorithm is the ability to generate action plans
    for any new hotspot distribution using the parameters learned on other similar
    looking distributions.

  paper_title: Modelling GxE with historical weather information improves genomic
    prediction in new environments
  abstract: 'Interaction between the genotype and the environment ($G \times E$) has
    a strong impact on the yield of major crop plants. Recently $G \times E$ has been
    predicted from environmental and genomic covariates, but existing works have not
    considered generalization to new environments and years without access to in-season
    data. We study \textit{in silico} the viability of $G \times E$ prediction under
    realistic constraints. We show that the environmental response of a new generation
    of untested Barley cultivars can be predicted in new locations and years using
    genomic data, machine learning and historical weather observations. Our results
    highlight the need for models of $G \times E$: non-linear effects clearly dominate
    linear ones and the interaction between the soil type and daily rain is identified
    as the main driver for $G \times E$. Our study implies that genomic selection
    can be used to capture the yield potential in $G \times E$ effects for future
    growth seasons, providing a possible means to achieve yield improvements. $G \times
    E$ models are also needed to select for varieties that react favourably to the
    altering climate conditions. For this purpose, the historical weather observations
    could be replaced by climate simulations to study the yield potential under various
    climate scenarios.This abstract summarizes the findings of a recently published
    article.'

  paper_title: Machine Learning empowered Occupancy Sensing for Smart Buildings
  abstract: Over half of the global electricity consumption is attributed to buildings,
    which are often operated poorly from an energy perspective. Significant improvements
    in energy efficiency can be achieved via intelligent building control techniques.
    To realize such advanced control schemes, accurate and robust occupancy information
    is highly valuable. In this work, we present a cutting-edge WiFi sensing platform
    and state-of-the-art machine learning methods to address longstanding occupancy
    sensing challenges in smart buildings. Our systematic solution provides comprehensive
    fine-grained occupancy information in a non-intrusive and privacy-preserving manner,
    which facilitates eco-friendly and sustainable buildings.

  paper_title: 'Focus and track: pixel-wise spatio-temporal hurricane tracking'
  abstract: We tackle extreme climate event tracking problem. It has unique challenges
    to other visual object tracking problems, including wider range of spatio-temporal
    dynamics, blur boundary of the target, and shortage of labeled dataset. In this
    paper, we propose a simple but robust end-to-end model based on multi-layered
    ConvLSTM, suitable for the climate event tracking problem. It first learns to
    imprint location and appearance of the target at the first frame with one-shot
    auto-encoding fashion, and then, the learned feature is consumed by the tracking
    module to track the target in subsequent time frames. To tackle the data shortage
    problem, we propose data augmentation based on Social GAN. Extensive experiments
    show that the proposed framework significantly improves tracking performance on
    hurricane tracking task over several state-of-the-art methods.

  paper_title: Recovering the parameters underlying the Lorenz-96 chaotic dynamics
  abstract: Climate projections suffer from uncertain equilibrium climate sensitivity.
    The reason behind this uncertainty is the resolution of global climate models,
    which is too coarse to resolve key processes such as clouds and convection. These
    processes are approximated using heuristics in a process called parameterization.
    The selection of these parameters can be subjective, leading to significant uncertainties
    in the way clouds are represented in global climate models. Here, we explore three
    deep network algorithms to infer these parameters in an objective and data-driven
    way. We compare the performance of a fully-connected network, a one-dimensional
    and, a two-dimensional convolutional networks to recover the underlying parameters
    of the Lorenz-96 model, a non-linear dynamical system that has similar behavior
    to the climate system.

  paper_title: Using Bayesian Optimization to Improve Solar Panel Performance by Developing
    Antireflective, Superomniphobic Glass
  abstract: Photovoltaic solar panel efficiency is dependent on photons transmitting
    through the glass sheet covering and into the crystalline silicon solar cells
    within.  However, complications such as soiling and light reflection degrade performance.
    Our goal is to identify a fabrication process to produce glass which promotes
    photon transmission and is superomniphobic (repels fluids), for easier cleaning.
    In this paper, we propose adapting Bayesian optimization to efficiently search
    the space of possible glass fabrication strategies; in this search we balance
    three competing objectives (transmittance, haze and oil contact angle). We present
    the glass generated from this Bayesian optimization strategy and detail its properties
    relevant to photovoltaic solar power.

  paper_title: A quantum mechanical approach for data assimilation in climate dynamics
  abstract: A framework for data assimilation in climate dynamics is presented, combining
    aspects of quantum mechanics, Koopman operator theory, and kernel methods for
    machine learning. This approach adapts the Dirac-von Neumann formalism of quantum
    dynamics and measurement to perform data assimilation (filtering) of climate dynamics,
    using the Koopman operator governing the evolution of observables as an analog
    of the Heisenberg operator in quantum mechanics, and a quantum mechanical density
    operator to represent  the data assimilation state. The framework is implemented
    in a fully empirical, data-driven manner, using kernel methods for machine learning
    to represent the evolution and measurement operators via matrices in a basis learned
    from time-ordered observations. Applications to data assimilation of the Nino
    3.4 index for the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) in a comprehensive climate
    model show promising results.

  paper_title: Data-driven Chance Constrained Programming based Electric Vehicle Penetration
    Analysis
  abstract: Transportation electrification has been growing rapidly in recent years.
    The adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) could help to release the dependency on
    oil and reduce greenhouse gas emission. However, the increasing EV adoption will
    also impose a high demand on the power grid and may jeopardize the grid network
    infrastructures. For certain high EV penetration areas, the EV charging demand
    may lead to transformer overloading at peak hours which makes the maximal EV penetration
    analysis an urgent problem to solve. This paper proposes a data-driven chance
    constrained programming based framework for maximal EV penetration analysis. Simulation
    results are presented for a real-world neighborhood level network. The proposed
    framework could serve as a guidance for utility companies to schedule infrastructure
    upgrades.

  paper_title: Machine Learning for AC Optimal Power Flow
  abstract: |-
    F(

    We explore machine learning methods for AC Optimal Powerflow (ACOPF) - the task of optimizing power generation in a transmission network according while respecting physical and engineering constraints. We present two formulations of ACOPF as a machine learning problem: 1) an end-to-end prediction task where we directly predict the optimal generator settings, and 2) a constraint prediction task where we predict the set of active constraints in the optimal solution. We validate these approaches on two benchmark grids.

  paper_title: Targeted Meta-Learning for Critical Incident Detection in Weather Data
  abstract: Due to imbalanced or heavy-tailed  nature of weather- and climate-related
    datasets, the performance of standard deep learning models significantly deviates
    from their expected behavior on test data. Classical methods to address these  issues
    are mostly data or application dependent, hence burdensome to tune. Meta-learning
    approaches, on the other hand, aim to learn hyperparameters in the learning process
    using different objective functions on training and validation data. However,
    these methods suffer from high computational complexity and are not scalable to
    large datasets. In this paper, we aim to apply a novel framework named as targeted
    meta-learning to rectify this issue, and show its efficacy in dealing with the
    aforementioned biases in datasets. This framework employs a small, well-crafted
    target dataset that resembles the desired nature of test data in order to guide
    the learning process in a coupled manner. We empirically show that this framework
    can overcome the bias issue, common to weather-related datasets, in a bow echo
    detection case study.

  paper_title: 'ClimateNet: Bringing the power of Deep Learning to weather and climate
    sciences via open datasets and architectures'
  abstract: Pattern recognition tasks such as classification, object detection and
    segmentation have remained challenging problems in the weather and climate sciences.
    While there exist many empirical heuristics for detecting weather patterns and
    extreme events, the disparities between the output of these different methods
    even for a single event are large and often difficult to reconcile. Given the
    success of Deep Learning in tackling similar problems in computer vision, we advocate
    a DL-based approach. However, DL works best in the context of supervised learning,
    when labeled datasets are readily available. Reliable, labeled training data is
    scarce in climate science. `ClimateNet' is an effort to solve this problem by
    creating open, community-sourced expert-labeled datasets that capture information
    pertaining to class or pattern labels, bounding boxes and segmentation masks.
    In this paper we present the motivation, design and status of the ClimateNet dataset
    and associated model architecture.

  paper_title: Improving Subseasonal Forecasting in the Western U.S. with Machine
    Learning
  abstract: Water managers in the western United States (U.S.) rely on longterm forecasts
    of temperature and precipitation to prepare for droughts and other wet weather
    extremes. To improve the accuracy of these long-term forecasts, the Bureau of
    Reclamation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) launched
    the Subseasonal Climate Forecast Rodeo, a year-long real-time forecasting challenge,
    in which participants aimed to skillfully predict temperature and precipitation
    in the western U.S. two to four weeks and four to six weeks in advance. We present
    and evaluate our machine learning approach to the Rodeo and release our SubseasonalRodeo
    dataset, collected to train and evaluate our forecasting system. Our predictive
    system is an ensemble of two regression models, and exceeds that of the top Rodeo
    competitor as well as the government baselines for each target variable and forecast
    horizon.

  paper_title: Unsupervised Temporal Clustering to Monitor the Performance of Alternative

  abstract: Zero Emission Vehicles (ZEV) play an important role in the decarbonization

    temporal clustering algorithm along with survey analysis to determine infrastructure
    performance and reliability of alternative fuels. We illustrate this approach
    for the hydrogen fueling stations in California, but this can be generalized for
    other regions and fuels.

  paper_title: A Flexible Pipeline for Prediction of Tropical Cyclone Paths
  abstract: Hurricanes and, more generally, tropical cyclones (TCs) are rare, complex
    natural phenomena of both scientific and public interest. The importance of understanding
    TCs in a changing climate has increased as recent TCs have had devastating impacts
    on human lives and communities. Moreover, good prediction and understanding about
    the complex nature of TCs can mitigate some of these human and property losses.
    Though TCs have been studied from many different angles, more work is needed from
    a statistical approach of providing prediction regions. The current state-of-the-art
    in TC prediction bands comes from the National Hurricane Center at NOAA, whose
    proprietary model provides "cones of uncertainty" for TCs through an analysis
    of historical forecast errors. The contribution of this paper is twofold. We introduce
    a new pipeline that encourages transparent and adaptable prediction band development
    by streamlining cyclone track simulation and prediction band generation. We also
    provide updates to existing models and novel statistical methodologies in both
    areas of the pipeline respectively.

  paper_title: Mapping land use and land cover changes faster and at scale with deep
    learning on the cloud
  abstract: Policymakers rely on Land Use and Land Cover (LULC) maps for evaluation
    and planning. They use these maps to plan climate-smart agriculture policy, improve
    housing resilience (to earthquakes or other natural disasters), and understand
    how to grow commerce in small communities. A number of institutions have created
    global land use maps from historic satellite imagery. However, these maps can
    be outdated and are often inaccurate, particularly in their representation of
    developing countries. We worked with the European Space Agency (ESA) to develop
    a LULC deep learning workflow on the cloud that can ingest Sentinel-2 optical
    imagery for a large scale LULC change detection. It’s an end-to-end workflow that
    sits on top of two comprehensive tools, SentinelHub, and eo-learn, which seamlessly
    link earth observation data with machine learning libraries. It can take in the
    labeled LULC and associated AOI in shapefiles, set up a task to fetch cloud-free,
    time series imagery stacks within the defined time interval by the users. It will
    pair the satellite imagery tile with it’s labeled LULC mask for the supervised
    deep learning model training on the cloud. Once a well-performing model is trained,
    it can be exported as a Tensorflow/Pytorch serving docker image to work with our
    cloud-based model inference pipeline. The inference pipeline can automatically
    scale with the number of images to be processed.  Changes in land use are heavily
    influenced by human activities (e.g. agriculture, deforestation, human settlement
    expansion) and have been a great source of greenhouse gas emissions. Sustainable
    forest and land management practices vary from region to region, which means having
    flexible, scalable tools will be critical. With these tools, we can empower analysts,
    engineers, and decision-makers to see where contributions to climate-smart agricultural,
    forestry and urban resilience programs can be made.

  paper_title: Achieving Conservation of Energy in Neural Network Emulators for Climate
    Modeling
  abstract: 'Artificial neural-networks have the potential to emulate cloud processes
    with higher accuracy than the semi-empirical emulators currently used in climate
    models. However, neural-network models do not intrinsically conserve energy and
    mass, which is an obstacle to using them for long-term climate predictions. Here,
    we propose two methods to enforce linear conservation laws in neural-network emulators
    of physical models: Constraining (1) the loss function or (2) the architecture
    of the network itself. Applied to the emulation of explicitly-resolved cloud processes
    in a prototype multi-scale climate model, we show that architecture constraints
    can enforce conservation laws to satisfactory numerical precision, while all constraints
    help the neural-network better generalize to conditions outside of its training
    set, such as global warming.'

  paper_title: The Impact of Feature Causality on Normal Behaviour Models for SCADA-based
    Wind Turbine Fault Detection
  abstract: The cost of wind energy can be reduced by using SCADA data to detect faults
    in wind turbine components. Normal behavior models are one of the main fault detection
    approaches, but there is a lack of work in how different input features affect
    the results. In this work, a new taxonomy based on the causal relations between
    the input features and the target is presented. Based on this taxonomy, the impact
    of different input feature configurations on the modelling and fault detection
    performance is evaluated. To this end, a framework that formulates the detection
    of faults as a classification problem is also presented.

  paper_title: Predicting CO2 Plume Migration using Deep Neural Networks
  abstract: Carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) is an essential climate change
    mitigation technology for achieving the 2 degree C target. Numerical simulation
    of CO2 plume migration in the subsurface is a prerequisite to effective CCS projects.
    However, stochastic high spatial resolution simulations are currently limited
    by computational resources. We propose a deep neural network approach to predict
    the CO2 plume migration in high dimensional systems with complex geology. Upon
    training, the network is able to give accurate predictions that are 6 orders of
    magnitude faster than traditional numerical simulators. This approach can be easily
    adopted to history-matching and uncertainty analysis problems to support the scale-up
    of CCS deployment.

  paper_title: Truck Traffic Monitoring with Satellite Images
  abstract: The road freight sector is responsible for a large and growing share of
    greenhouse gas emissions, but reliable data on the amount of freight that is moved
    on roads in many parts of the world are scarce.  Many low- and middle-income countries
    have limited ground-based traffic monitoring and freight surveying activities.
    In this proof of concept, we show that we can use an object detection network
    to count trucks in satellite images and predict average annual daily truck traffic
    from those counts. We describe a complete model, test the uncertainty of the estimation,
    and discuss the transfer to developing countries.

  paper_title: Evaluating aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties of time series deep
    learning models for soil moisture predictions
  abstract: Soil moisture is an important variable that determines floods, vegetation
    health, agriculture productivity, and land surface feedbacks to the atmosphere,
    etc.. The recently available satellite-based observations give us a unique opportunity
    to directly build data-driven models to predict soil moisture instead of using
    land surface models, but previously there was no uncertainty estimate. We tested
    Monte Carlo dropout with an aleatoric term (MCD+A) for our long short-term memory
    models for this problem, and ask if the uncertainty terms behave as they were
    argued to. We show that MCD+A indeed gave a good estimate of our predictive error,
    provided we tune a hyperparameter and use a representative training dataset. The
    aleatoric term responded strongly to observational noise and the epistemic term
    clearly acted as a detector for physiographic dissimilarity from the training
    data. However, when the training and test data are characteristically different,
    the aleatoric term could be misled, undermining its reliability. We will also
    discuss some of the major challenges for which we anticipate the geoscientific
    communities will need help from computer scientists in applying AI to climate
    or hydrologic modeling.

  paper_title: Detecting anthropogenic cloud perturbations with deep learning
  abstract: One of the most pressing questions in climate science is that of the effect
    of anthropogenic aerosol on the Earth's energy balance. Aerosols provide the `seeds'
    on which cloud droplets form, and changes in the amount of aerosol available to
    a cloud can change its brightness and other physical properties such as optical
    thickness and spatial extent. Clouds play a critical role in moderating global
    temperatures and small perturbations can lead to significant amounts of cooling
    or warming. Uncertainty in this effect is so large it is not currently known if
    it is negligible, or provides a large enough cooling to largely negate present-day
    warming by CO2. This work uses deep convolutional neural networks to look for
    two particular perturbations in clouds due to anthropogenic aerosol and assess
    their properties and prevalence, providing valuable insights into their climatic
    effects.

  paper_title: 'Data-driven surrogate models for climate modeling: application of
    echo state networks, RNN-LSTM and ANN to the multi-scale Lorenz system as a test
    case'
  abstract: Understanding the effects of climate change relies on physics driven computationally
    expensive climate models which are still imperfect owing to ineffective subgrid
    scale parametrization. An effective way to treat these ineffective parametrization
    of largely uncertain subgrid scale processes are data-driven surrogate models
    with machine learning techniques. These surrogate models train on observational
    data capturing either the embed- dings of their (subgrid scale processes’) underlying
    dynamics on the large scale processes or to simulate the subgrid processes accurately
    to be fed into the large scale processes. In this paper an extended version of
    the Lorenz 96 system is studied, which consists of three equations for a set of
    slow, intermediate, and fast variables, providing a fitting prototype for multi-scale,
    spatio-temporal chaos, and in particular, the complex dynamics of the climate
    system. In this work, we have built a data-driven model based on echo state net-
    works (ESN) aimed, specifically at climate modeling. This model can predict the
    spatio-temporal chaotic evolution of the Lorenz system for several Lyapunov timescales.
    We show that the ESN model outperforms, in terms of the prediction horizon, a
    deep learning technique based on recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term
    memory (LSTM) and an artificial neural network by factors between 3 and 10. The
    results suggest that ESN has the potential for being a powerful method for surrogate
    modeling and data-driven prediction for problems of interest to the climate community.

  paper_title: Learning Radiative Transfer Models for Climate Change Applications
    in Imaging Spectroscopy
  abstract: According to a recent investigation, an estimated 33-50% of the world's
    coral reefs have undergone degradation, believed to be as a result of climate
    change. A strong driver of climate change and the subsequent environmental impact
    are greenhouse gases such as methane. However, the exact relation climate change
    has to the environmental condition cannot be easily established. Remote sensing
    methods are increasingly being used to quantify and draw connections between rapidly
    changing climatic conditions and environmental impact. A crucial part of this
    analysis is processing spectroscopy data using radiative transfer models (RTMs)
    which is a computationally expensive process and limits their use with high volume
    imaging spectrometers. This work presents an algorithm that can efficiently emulate
    RTMs using neural networks leading to a multifold speedup in processing time,
    and yielding multiple downstream benefits.

  paper_title: Planetary Scale Monitoring of Urban Growth in High Flood Risk Areas
  abstract: Climate  change  is  increasing  the  incidence of flooding. Many areas
    in the developing world are experiencing strong population growth but lack adequate
    urban planning. This represents a significant humanitarian risk. We explore the
    use of high-cadence satellite imagery provided by Planet, who’s flock of over
    one hundred ’Dove’ satellites image the entire earth’s landmass everyday at 3-5m
    resolution. We use a deep learning-based computer vision approach to measure flood-related
    humanitarian risk in 5 cities in Africa.

  paper_title: Efficient Multi-temporal and In-season Crop Mapping with Landsat Analysis
    Ready Data via Long Short-term Memory Networks
  abstract: Globe crop analysis from plentiful satellite images yields state-of-the-art
    results about estimating climate change impacts on agriculture with modern machine
    learning technology. Generating accurate and timely crop mapping across years
    remains a scientific challenge since existing non-temporal classifiers are hardly
    capable of capturing complicated temporal links from multi-temporal remote sensing
    data and adapting to interannual variability. We developed an LSTM-based model
    trained by previous years to distinguish corn and soybean for the current year.
    The results showed that LSTM outperformed random forest baseline in both in-season
    and end-of-the-season crop type classification. The improved performance is a
    result of the cumulative effect of remote sensing information that has been learned
    by LSTM model structure. The work pF(24rovides a valuable opportunity for estimating
    the impact of climate change on crop yield and early warning of extreme weather
    events in the future.

  paper_title: Autopilot of Cement Plants for Reduction of Fuel Consumption and Emissions
  abstract: The cement manufacturing industry is an essential component of the global
    economy and infrastructure. However, cement plants inevitably produce hazardous
    air pollutants, including greenhouse gases, and heavy metal emissions as byproducts
    of the process. Byproducts from cement manufacturing alone accounts for approximately
    5% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. We have developed "Autopilot" - a
    machine learning based Software as a Service (SaaS) to learn manufacturing process
    dynamics and optimize the operation of cement plants - in order to reduce the
    overall fuel consumption and emissions of cement production.  Autopilot is able
    to increase the ratio of alternative fuels (including biowaste and tires) to Petroleum
    coke, while optimizing operation of pyro, the core process of cement production
    that includes the preheater, kiln and cooler. Emissions of gases such as NOx and
    SOx, and heavy metals such as mercury and lead which are generated through burning
    petroleum coke can be reduced through the use of Autopilot. Our system has been
    proven to work in real world deployments and an analysis of cement plant performance
    with Autopilot enabled shows energy consumption savings and a  decrease of up
    to 28,000 metric tons of CO2 produced per year.

  paper_title: Towards a Sustainable Food Supply Chain Powered by Artificial Intelligence
  abstract: About 30-40% of food produced worldwide is wasted. This puts a severe
    strain on the environment and represents a $165B loss to the US economy. This
    paper explores how artificial intelligence can be used to automate decisions across
    the food supply chain in order to reduce waste and increase the quality and affordability
    of food. We focus our attention on supermarkets — combined with downstream consumer
    waste, these contribute to 40% of total US food losses — and we describe an intelligent
    decision support system for supermarket operators that optimizes purchasing decisions
    and minimizes losses. The core of our system is a model-based reinforcement learn-
    ing engine for perishable inventory management; in a real-world pilot with a US
    supermarket chain, our system reduced waste by up to 50%. We hope that this paper
    will bring the food waste problem to the attention of the broader machine learning
    research community.

  paper_title: 'PVNet: A LRCN Architecture for Spatio-Temporal Photovoltaic Power
    Forecasting from Numerical Weather Prediction'
  abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) power generation has emerged as one of the leading renewable
    energy sources. Yet, its production is characterized by high uncertainty, being
    dependent on weather conditions like solar irradiance and temperature. Predicting
    PV production, even in the 24-hour forecast, remains a challenge and leads energy
    providers to left idling - often carbon-emitting - plants. In this paper, we introduce
    a Long-Term Recurrent Convolutional Network using Numerical Weather Predictions
    (NWP) to predict, in turn, PV production in the 24-hour and 48-hour forecast horizons.
    This network architecture fully leverages both temporal and spatial weather data,
    sampled over the whole geographical area of interest. We train our model on a
    prediction dataset from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)
    to predict spatially aggregated PV production in Germany. We compare its performance
    to the persistence model and state-of-the-art methods.

  paper_title: Finding Ship-tracks Using Satellite Data to Enable Studies of Climate
    and Trade Related Issues
  abstract: Ship-tracks appear as long winding linear features in satellite images
    and are produced by aerosols from ship exhausts changing low cloud properties.
    They are one of the best examples of aerosol-cloud interaction experiments, which
    is currently the largest source of uncertainty in our understanding of climate
    forcing.  Manually finding ship-tracks from satellite data on a large-scale is
    prohibitively costly while a large number of samples are required to better understand
    aerosol-cloud interactions. Here we train a deep neural network to automate finding
    ship-tracks. The neural network model generalizes well as it not only finds ship-tracks
    labeled by human experts, but also detects those that are occasionally missed
    by humans. It increases our sampling capability of ship-tracks by orders of magnitude
    and produces a first global map of ship-track distributions using satellite data.
    Major shipping routes that are mapped by the algorithm correspond well with available
    commercial data. There are also situations where commercial data are missing shipping
    routes that are detected by our algorithm. Our technique will enable studying
    aerosol effects on low clouds using ship-tracks on a large-scale, which will potentially
    narrow the uncertainty of the aerosol-cloud interactions. The product is also
    useful for applications such as coastal air pollution and trade.

  paper_title: Deep Learning for Wildlife Conservation and Restoration Efforts
  abstract: Climate change and environmental degradation are causing species extinction
    worldwide. Automatic wildlife sensing is an urgent requirement to track biodiversity
    losses on Earth. Recent improvements in machine learning can accelerate the development
    of large-scale monitoring systems that would help track conservation outcomes
    and target efforts. In this paper, we present one such system we developed. 'Tidzam'
    is a Deep Learning framework for wildlife detection, identification, and geolocalization,
    designed for the Tidmarsh Wildlife Sanctuary, the site of the largest freshwater
    wetland restoration in Massachusetts.

  paper_title: Reinforcement Learning for Sustainable Agriculture
  abstract: The growing population and the changing climate will push modern agriculture
    to its limits in an increasing number of regions on earth. Establishing next-generation
    sustainable food supply systems will mean producing more food on less arable land,
    while keeping the environmental impact to a minimum. Modern machine learning methods
    have achieved super-human performance on a variety of tasks, simply learning from
    the outcomes of their actions. We propose a path towards more sustainable agriculture,
    considering plant development an optimization problem with respect to certain
    parameters, such as yield and environmental impact, which can be optimized in
    an automated way. Specifically, we propose to use reinforcement learning to autonomously
    explore and learn ways of influencing the development of certain types of plants,
    controlling environmental parameters, such as irrigation or nutrient supply, and
    receiving sensory feedback, such as camera images, humidity, and moisture measurements.
    The trained system will thus be able to provide instructions for optimal treatment
    of a local population of plants, based on non-invasive measurements, such as imaging.

  paper_title: Stratospheric Aerosol Injection as a Deep Reinforcement Learning Problem
  abstract: As global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, the use of geoengineering
    in order to artificially mitigate climate change effects is increasingly considered.
    Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI), which reduces solar radiative forcing and
    thus can be used to offset excess radiative forcing due to the greenhouse effect,
    is both technically and economically feasible. However, naive deployment of SAI
    has been shown in simulation to produce highly adversarial regional climatic effects
    in regions such as India and West Africa. Wealthy countries would most likely
    be able to trigger SAI unilaterally, i.e. China, Russia or US could decide to
    fix their own climates and, by collateral damage, drying India out by disrupting
    the monsoon or inducing termination effects with rapid warming. Understanding
    both how SAI can be optimised and how to best react to rogue injections is therefore
    of crucial geostrategic interest.  In this paper, we argue that optimal SAI control
    can be characterised as a high-dimensional Markov Decision Process. This motivates
    the use of deep reinforcement learning in order to automatically discover non-trivial,
    and potentially time-varying, optimal injection policies or identify catastrophic
    ones. To overcome the inherent sample inefficiency of deep reinforcement learning,
    we propose to emulate a Global Circulation Model using deep learning techniques.
    To our knowledge, this is the first proposed application of deep reinforcement
    learning to the climate sciences.

  paper_title: Using Natural Language Processing to Analyze Financial Climate Disclosures
  abstract: According to U.S. financial legislation, companies traded on the stock
    market are obliged to regularly disclose risks and uncertainties that are likely
    to affect their operations or financial position. Since 2010, these disclosures
    must also include climate-related risk projections. These disclosures therefore
    present a large quantity of textual information on which we can apply NLP techniques
    in order to pinpoint the companies that divulge their climate risks and those
    that do not, the types of vulnerabilities that are disclosed, and to follow the
    evolution of these risks over time.

  paper_title: 'Machine Learning-based Maintenance for Renewable Energy: The Case
    of Power Plants in Morocco'
  abstract: 'In this project, the focus will be on the reduction of the overall electricity
    cost by the reduction of operating expenditures, including maintenance costs.
    We propose a predictive maintenance (PdM) framework for multi-component systems
    in renewables power plants based on machine learning (ML) and optimization approaches.
    This project would benefit from a real database acquired from the Moroccan Agency
    Of Sustainable Energy (MASEN) that own and operate several wind, solar and hydro
    power plants spread over Moroccan territory. Morocco has launched an ambitious
    energy strategy since 2009 that aims to ensure the energy security of the country,
    diversify the source of energy and preserve the environment. Ultimately, Morocco
    has set the target of 52% of renewables by 2030 with a large capital investment
    of USD 30 billion. To this end, Morocco will install 10 GW allocated as follows:
    45% for solar, 42% for wind and 13% for hydro. Through the commitment of many
    actors, in particular in Research and Development, Morocco intends to become a
    regional leader and a model to follow in its climate change efforts. MASEN is
    investing in several strategies to reduce the cost of renewables, including the
    cost of operations and maintenance. Our project will provide a ML predictive maintenance
    framework to support these efforts.'

  paper_title: Machine Intelligence for Floods and the Built Environment Under Climate
    Change
  abstract: While intensification of precipitation extremes has been attributed to
    anthropogenic climate change using statistical analysis and physics-based numerical
    models, understanding floods in a climate context remains a grand challenge. Meanwhile,
    an increasing volume of Earth science data from climate simulations, remote sensing,
    and Geographic Information System (GIS) tools offers opportunity for data-driven
    insight and action plans.  Defining Machine Intelligence (MI) broadly to include
    machine learning and network science, here we develop a vision and use preliminary
    results to showcase how scientific understanding of floods can be improved in
    a climate context and translated to impacts with a focus on Critical Lifeline
    Infrastructure Networks (CLIN).

  paper_title: Predicting Marine Heatwaves using Global Climate Models with Cluster

  abstract: Marine heatwaves make human and natural systems vulnerable to disaster

    extreme warming events in sea surface temperature are expected to become more
    frequent and longer lasting as a result of climate change. Large ensembles of
    global climate models now provide petabytes of climate-relevant data and an opportunity
    to probe machine learning to glean new insights about the climate conditions that
    cause marine heatwaves. Here we propose a k-means cluster based learning objective
    to map the geography of marine heatwave drivers globally to build a forecast for
    extreme sea surface temperatures using Long Short-Term Memory. We describe our
    machine learning approach to predict when and where future marine heatwaves will
    occur while leveraging the massive output of data from global climate models where
    traditional forecasting approaches fall short. The impacts of this work could
    warn coastal communities by providing a forecast for marine heatwaves, which would
    mitigate the negative effects on fishery productivity, ecosystem health, and tourism.

  paper_title: ML-driven search for zero-emissions ammonia production materials
  abstract: Ammonia (NH3) production is an industrial process that consumes between
    1-2% of global energy  annually  and  is  responsible  for  2-3%  of greenhouse
    gas emissions (Van der Ham et al.,2014).  Ammonia is primarily used for agricultural
    fertilizers, but it also conforms to the US-DOE targets for hydrogen storage materials
    (Lanet al., 2012). Modern industrial facilities use the century-old Haber-Bosch
    process, whose energy usage  and  carbon  emissions  are  strongly  dominated
    by the use of methane as the combined energy source and hydrogen feedstock, not
    by the energy used to maintain elevated temperatures and pressures (Pfromm, 2017).
    Generating the hydrogen feedstock with renewable electricity through water electrolysis
    is an option that would allow retrofitting the billions of dollars of invested
    capital  in  Haber-Bosch  production  capacity.   Economic viability is however
    strongly dependent on the relative regional prices of methane and renewable energy;
    renewables have been trending lower in cost but forecasting methane prices is  difficult  (Stehly  et  al.,  2018;  IRENA,  2017;
    Wainberg et al., 2017). Electrochemical ammonia production, which can use aqueous
    or steam H2O as  its  hydrogen  source  (first  demonstrated   ̃20years ago) is
    a promising means of emissions-free ammonia production. Its viability is also
    linked to the relative price of renewable energy versus methane, but in principle
    it can be significantly more cost-effective than Haber-Bosch (Giddeyet al., 2013)
    and also downscale to developing areas lacking ammonia transport infrastructure(Shipman
    & Symes, 2017). However to date it has only been demonstrated at laboratory scales
    with yields and Faradaic efficiencies insufficient to be economically competitive.  Promising
    machine-learning approaches to fix this are discussed.

  paper_title: Low-carbon urban planning with machine learning
  abstract: Widespread climate action is urgently needed, but current solutions do
    not account enough for local differences. Here, we take the example of cities
    to point to the potential of machine learning (ML) for generating at scale high-resolution
    information on energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and make this information
    actionable for concrete solutions. We map the existing relevant ML literature
    and articulate ML methods that can make sense of spatial data for climate solutions
    in cities. Machine learning has the potential to find solutions that are tailored
    for each settlement, and transfer solutions across the world.

  paper_title: The Grid Resilience & Intelligence Platform (GRIP)
  abstract: Extreme weather events pose an enormous and increasing threat to the nation’s
    electric power systems and the associated socio-economic systems that depend on
    reliable delivery of electric power. The US Department of Energy reported in 2015,
    almost a quarter of unplanned grid outages were caused by extreme weather events
    and variability in the environment. Because climate change increases the frequency
    and severity of extreme weather events, communities everywhere will need to take
    steps to better prepare for, and if possible prevent major outages. While utilities
    have software tools available to help plan their daily and future operations,
    these tools do not include capabilities to help them plan for and recover from
    extreme events. Software for resilient design and recovery is not available commercially
    and research efforts in this area are preliminary. In this project, we are developing
    and deploying a suite of novel software tools to anticipate, absorb and recover
    from extreme events. The innovations in the project include the application of
    artificial intelligence and machine learning for distribution grid resilience,
    specifically, by using predictive analytics, image recognition and classification,
    and increased learning and problem-solving capabilities for the anticipation of
    grid events.

  paper_title: Meta-Optimization of Optimal Power Flow
  abstract: The planning and operation of electricity grids is carried out by solving
    various forms of con- strained optimization problems. With the increasing variability
    of system conditions due to the integration of renewable and other distributed
    energy resources, such optimization problems are growing in complexity and need
    to be repeated daily, often limited to a 5 minute solve-time. To address this,
    we propose a meta-optimizer that is used to initialize interior-point solvers.
    This can significantly reduce the number of iterations to converge to optimality.

  paper_title: Learning representations to predict landslide occurrences and detect
    illegal mining across multiple domains
  abstract: Modelling landslide occurrences is challenging due to lack of valuable
    prior information on the trigger. Satellites can provide crucial insights for
    identifying landslide activity and characterizing patterns spatially and temporally.
    We propose to analyze remote sensing data from affected regions using deep learning
    methods, find correlation in the changes over time, and predict future landslide
    occurrences and their potential causes. The learned networks can then be applied
    to generate task-specific imagery, including but not limited to, illegal mining
    detection and disaster relief modelling.

  paper_title: Harness the Power of Artificial intelligence and -Omics to Identify
    Soil Microbial Functions in Climate Change Projection
  abstract: Contemporary Earth system models (ESMs) omit one of the significant drivers
    of the terrestrial carbon cycle, soil microbial communities. Soil microbial community
    not only directly emit greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere through the respiration
    process, but also release diverse enzymes to catalyze the decomposition of soil
    organic matter and determine nutrient availability for aboveground vegetation.
    Therefore, soil microbial community control over terrestrial carbon dynamics and
    their feedbacks to climate. Currently, inadequate representation of soil microbial
    communities in ESMs has introduced significant uncertainty in current terrestrial
    carbon-climate feedbacks. Mitigation of this uncertainty requires to identify
    functions, diversity, and environmental adaptation of soil microbial communities
    under global climate change. The revolution of -omics technology allows high throughput
    quantification of diverse soil enzymes, enabling large-scale studies of microbial
    functions in climate change. Such studies may lead to revolutionary solutions
    to predicting microbial-mediated climate-carbon feedbacks at the global scale
    based on gene-level environmental adaptation strategies of the microbial community.
    A key initial step in this direction is to identify the biogeography and environmental
    adaptation of soil enzyme functions based on the massive amount of data generated
    by -omics technologies. Here we propose to make this step. Artificial intelligence
    is a powerful, ideal tool for this leap forward. Our project is to integrate Artificial
    intelligence technologies and global -omics data to represent climate controls
    on microbial enzyme functions and mapping biogeography of soil enzyme functional
    groups at global scale. This outcome of this study will allow us to improve the
    representation of microbial function in earth system modeling and mitigate uncertainty
    in current climate projection.
