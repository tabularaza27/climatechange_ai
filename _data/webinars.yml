   One of the most significant, and perhaps most misunderstood, risks that financial institutions face today relates to climate change. 
   It is more important than ever that these institutions lead in understanding and responding to these risks—and seizing the opportunities—to
   build a stronger, more resilient, and sustainable global economy. Addressing this need requires innovative thinking, analytics, and a new 
   business mindset. In this webinar, we will discuss key business issues related to the impact of climate change on financial institutions, 
   application of traditional quant and advanced AI/ML techniques in addressing these issues, and challenges and considerations in implementing such techniques.

   Cities represent the lion’s share of the world’s energy use and GHG emissions, requiring rapid mitigation action. 
   The spatial configurations of the built environment, in particular buildings and streets, strongly impact energy 
   requirements for housing and mobility, depending for example on the density or destination accessibility in cities. 
   In this webinar, we will go over machine learning approaches to analyze large volumes of data and find urban planning 
   strategies that can both reduce the carbon footprint of cities and improve the quality of life of their residents.

    In this webinar, we hosted <a href="https://desp.ucdavis.edu/people/frances-c-moore" target="_blank"><b>Dr. Frances Moore</b></a> (University of California Davis) 
    and <a href="https://www.climatecentral.org/what-we-do/people/scott-kulp" target="_blank"><b>Dr. Scott Kulp</b></a> (Climate Central)
    to discuss their work using big data and machine learning to better understand the impacts of sea level rise.
    <br><br>
    Dr. Frances Moore:
    <br>
    Climate change is likely to significantly increase flooding in coastal areas due to 
    a combination of higher sea levels and more intense rainfall events. Nuisance tidal
    flooding is already causing disruption in coastal communities throughout the US,
    and yet the frequency and intensity of these events is poorly measured- coastal tide 
    gauges are relatively sparse and flood thresholds are not well standardized across
    gauges. Social-media data inherently contains data on both the extent, frequency,
    and social disruption of flood events, making it a useful complement of traditional
    gauge data. We show that data from Twitter suggests tidal flooding is occurring more
    frequently in many areas along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts than would be inferred 
    from tide gauges.

    <br><br>

    Dr. Scott Kulp:
    <br>
    Understanding where and how many people are living on land threatened by rising sea levels 
    is crucial for coastal planning and assessing the benefits of climate mitigation. At the 
    heart of such an analysis is the digital elevation model (DEM) -- a map of land elevation 
    that allows us to determine which areas may be below the future high tide line. However, 
    while high-precision DEMs are available in a few countries, most regions use 
    lower-quality satellite-derived data that see trees and buildings as hills and mountains, 
    causing vulnerability assessments to greatly underestimate the threats. In this webinar, 
    we will discuss how an artificial neural network was used to predict and remove the 
    errors present in the global DEM, revealing that the global coastline may be 3x more
    vulnerable to sea level rise and flooding than previously thought.

   Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land-Use (AFOLU) play a key role in climate change, contributing as much as 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions. 
   Agriculture and forestry need to become more efficient and adaptable to changes in weather patterns, the impacts of pests, water scarcity, etc. 
   In this context, the first part of the webinar will discuss applications of machine learning to climate-relevant ecological monitoring and conservation of forests.
   The second part of the webinar will discuss the role of machine learning to increase agricultural resilience in a changing climate.

    Tackling climate change is costly, but letting greenhouse gas emissions grow unchecked is even more expensive. 
    The Social Cost of Carbon, or “SCC”, allows us to assess this tradeoff by measuring the monetized damages 
    associated with the release of one ton of CO2. The SCC plays a central role in determining the nature and 
    stringency of climate policy both in the US and abroad, but existing estimates rely on extremely outdated 
    scientific evidence. In this webinar, we will discuss what is needed to bring the SCC back to the scientific
    frontier, focusing on the importance of big data and data science tools in a modern SCC framework.

    Climate change mitigation requires substantial investment, technology
    development and political effort. However, this large-scale task cannot
    be accomplished without considering important ethical and social
    considerations. Climate change mitigation should be accomplished in such
    a way that historically marginalized and vulnerable groups across the
    world have equitable access to mitigation technologies, financial
    incentives, and social rewards. How can this goal be achieved? Is data
    science and AI useful for this purpose? In this webinar, we will learn
    from the panelists in industry and academia and will aim to identify
    challenges and opportunities for AI in this field.
