- paper_title: Flood Segmentation on Sentinel-1 SAR Imagery with Semi-Supervised Learning
  abstract: Floods wreak havoc throughout the world, causing billions of dollars in
    damages, and uprooting communities, ecosystems and economies. The NASA Impact
    Emerging Techniques in Computational Intelligence (ETCI) competition on Flood
    Detection tasked participants with predicting flooded pixels after training with
    synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images in a supervised setting. We propose a semi-supervised
    learning pseudo-labeling scheme that derives confidence estimates from U-Net ensembles,
    thereby progressively improving accuracy. Concretely, we use a cyclical approach
    involving multiple stages (1) training an ensemble model of multiple U-Net architectures
    with the provided high confidence hand-labeled data and, generated pseudo labels
    or low confidence labels on the entire unlabeled test dataset, and then, (2) filter
    out quality generated labels and, (3) combine the generated labels with the previously
    available high confidence hand-labeled dataset. This assimilated dataset is used
    for the next round of training ensemble models. This cyclical process is repeated
    until the performance improvement plateaus. Additionally, we post process our
    results with Conditional Random Fields. Our approach sets a high score, and a
    new state-of-the-art on the Sentinel-1 dataset for the ETCI competition with 0.7654
    IoU, an impressive improvement over the 0.60 IOU baseline. Our method, which we
    release with all the code including trained models, can also be used as an open
    science benchmark for the Sentinel-1 released dataset.

- paper_title: Short-term Solar Irradiance Prediction from Sky Images
  abstract: "Solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the integration of the
    \nsolar power into the power grid system while maintaining its stability.\nThis
    paper focuses on short-term solar irradiance forecasting \n(upto 4-hour ahead-of-time
    prediction) from a past sky image sequence. Most existing\nwork aims for the prediction
    of the most likely future of the solar\nirradiance. While it is likely deterministic
    for intra-hourly prediction,\nthe future solar irradiance is naturally diverse
    over a relatively\nlong-term horizon (>1h). We therefore introduce approaches
    to\ndeterministic and stochastic predictions to capture the most likely\nas well
    as the diverse future of the solar irradiance. \nTo enable the autoregressive
    prediction capability of the model, \nwe proposed deep neural networks to predict
    the future \nsky images in a deterministic as well as stochastic manner. \nWe
    evaluate our approaches on benchmark datasets and demonstrate that\nour approaches
    achieve superior performance.\n"

- paper_title: Towards Representation Learning for Atmospheric Dynamics
  abstract: 'The prediction of future climate scenarios under anthropogenic forcing
    is critical to understand climate change and to assess the impact of potentially
    counter-acting technologies. Machine learning and hybrid techniques for this prediction
    rely on informative metrics that are sensitive to pertinent but often subtle influences.
    For atmospheric dynamics, a critical part of the climate system, no well established
    metric exists and visual inspection is currently still often used in practice.
    However, this ``eyeball metric'''' cannot be used for machine learning where an
    algorithmic description is required. Motivated by the success of intermediate
    neural network activations as basis for learned metrics, e.g. in computer vision,
    we present a novel, self-supervised representation learning approach specifically
    designed for atmospheric dynamics. Our approach, called AtmoDist, trains a neural
    network on a simple, auxiliary task: predicting the temporal distance between
    elements of a randomly shuffled sequence of atmospheric fields (e.g. the components
    of the wind field from reanalysis or simulation). The task forces the network
    to learn important intrinsic aspects of the data as activations in its layers
    and from these hence a discriminative metric can be obtained. We demonstrate this
    by using AtmoDist to define a metric for GAN-based super resolution of vorticity
    and divergence. Our upscaled data matches both visually and in terms of its statistics
    a high resolution reference closely and it significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
    based on mean squared error. Since AtmoDist is unsupervised, only requires a temporal
    sequence of fields, and uses a simple auxiliary task, it has the potential to
    be of utility in a wide range of applications.'

- paper_title: Addressing Deep Learning Model Uncertainty in Long-Range Climate Forecasting
    with Late Fusion
  abstract: Global warming leads to the increase in frequency and intensity of climate
    extremes that cause tremendous loss of lives and property. Accurate long-range
    climate prediction allows more time for preparation and disaster risk management
    for such extreme events. Although machine learning approaches have shown promising
    results in long-range climate forecasting, the associated model uncertainties
    may reduce their reliability. To address this issue, we propose a late fusion
    approach that systematically combines the predictions from multiple models to
    reduce the expected errors of the fused results. We also propose a network architecture
    with the novel denormalization layer to gain the benefits of data normalization
    without actually normalizing the data. The experimental results on long-range
    2m temperature forecasting show that the framework outperforms the 30-year climate
    normals, and the accuracy can be improved by increasing the number of models.

- paper_title: 'Predicting Discharge in Catchment Outlet Using Deep Learning: Case
    Study of the Ansongo-Niamey Basin'
  abstract: Hydrological models are one of the key challenges in hydrology. Their
    goal is to understand, predict and manage water resources. Most of the hydrological
    models so far were either physical or conceptual models. But in the past two decades,
    fully data-driven (empirical) models started to emerge with the breakthroughs
    of novel deep learning methods in runoff prediction. These breakthroughs were
    mostly favored by the large volume, variety and velocity of water-related data.
    Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Unit neural networks, particularly
    achieved the outstanding milestone of outperforming classic hydrological models
    in less than a decade. Moreover, they have the potential to change the way hydrological
    modeling is performed. In this study, precipitation, minimal and maximum temperature
    at the Ansongo-Niamey basin combined with the discharge at Ansongo and Kandadji
    were used to predict the discharge at Niamey using artificial neural networks.
    After data preprocessing and hyperparameter optimization, the deep learning models
    performed well with the LSTM and GRU respectively scoring a Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency
    of 0.933 and 0.935. This performance matches those of well-known physically-based
    models used to simulate Niamey’s discharge and therefore demonstrates the efficiency
    of deep learning methods in a West African context, especially in Niamey which
    has been facing severe floods due to climate change.

- paper_title: Accurate and Timely Forecasts of Geologic Carbon Storage using Machine
    Learning Methods
  abstract: Carbon capture and storage is one strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
    One approach to storing the captured CO2 is to inject it into deep saline aquifers.
    However, dynamics of the injected CO2 plume is uncertain and the potential for
    leakage back to the atmosphere must be assessed. Thus, accurate and timely forecasts
    of CO2 storage via real-time measurements integration becomes very crucial. This
    study proposes a learning-based, inverse-free prediction method that can accurately
    and rapidly forecast CO2 movement and distribution with uncertainty quantification
    based on limited simulation and observation data. The machine learning techniques
    include dimension reduction, multivariate data analysis, and Bayesian learning.
    The outcome is expected to provide CO2 storage site operators with an effective
    tool for real-time decision making.

    translation networks
  abstract: Climate models form the basis of a vast portion of earth system research,
    and inform our climate policy. Due to the complex nature of our climate system,
    and the approximations which must necessarily be made in simulating it, these
    climate models may not perfectly match observations. For further research, these
    outputs must be bias corrected against observations, but current methods of debiasing
    do not take into account spatial correlations. We evaluate unsupervised image-to-image
    translation networks, specifically the UNIT model architecture, for their ability
    to produce more spatially realistic debiasing than the standard techniques used
    in the climate community.

  abstract: "Aerosol-cloud interactions include a myriad of effects that all begin
    when aerosol enters a cloud and acts as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). \nAn
    increase in CCN results in a decrease in the mean cloud droplet size (r$_{e}$).\nThe
    smaller droplet size leads to brighter, more expansive, and longer lasting clouds
    that reflect more incoming sunlight, thus cooling the earth.\nGlobally, aerosol-cloud
    interactions cool the Earth, however the strength of the effect is heterogeneous
    over different meteorological regimes.\nUnderstanding how aerosol-cloud interactions
    evolve as a function of the local environment can help us better understand sources
    of error in our Earth system models, which currently fail to reproduce the observed
    relationships. \nIn this work we use recent non-linear, causal machine learning
    methods to study the heterogeneous effects of aerosols on cloud droplet radius."

    Semantic Segmentation'
  abstract: Global flood risk has increased due to worsening extreme weather events
    and human migration into growing flood-prone areas. Accurate, high-resolution,
    and near-real time flood maps can address flood risk by reducing financial loss
    and damage. We propose Model to Map, a novel machine learning approach that utilizes
    bi-temporal context to improve flood water segmentation performance for Sentinel-1
    imagery. We show that the inclusion of unflooded context for the area, or "memory,"
    allows the model to tap into a "prior state" of pre-flood conditions, increasing
    performance in geographic regions in which single-image radar-based flood mapping
    methods typically underperform (e.g. deserts). We focus on accuracy across different
    biomes to ensure global performance. Our experiments and novel data processing
    technique show that the confluence of pre-flood and permanent water context provides
    a 21% increase in mIoU over the baseline overall, and over 87% increase in deserts.

- paper_title: 'Hurricane Forecasting: A Novel Multimodal Machine Learning Framework'
  abstract: |-
    This paper describes a machine learning (ML) framework for tropical cyclone intensity and track forecasting, combining multiple distinct ML techniques and utilizing diverse data sources. Our framework, which we refer to as Hurricast (HURR), is built upon the combination of distinct data processing techniques using gradient-boosted trees and novel encoder-decoder architectures, including CNN, GRU and Transformers components. We propose a deep-learning feature extractor methodology to mix spatial-temporal data with statistical data efficiently. Our multimodal framework unleashes the potential of making forecasts based on a wide range of data sources, including historical storm data, and visual data such as reanalysis atmospheric images.
    We evaluate our models with current operational forecasts in North Atlantic (NA) and Eastern Pacific (EP) basins on 2016-2019 for 24-hour lead time, and show our models consistently outperform statistical-dynamical models and compete with the best dynamical models.
    Furthermore, the inclusion of Hurricast into an operational forecast consensus model leads to a significant improvement of 5% - 15% over NHC's official forecast, thus highlighting the complementary properties with existing approaches.

- paper_title: Improved Drought Forecasting Using Surrogate Quantile And Shape (SQUASH)
    Loss
  abstract: Droughts are amongst the most damaging natural hazard with cascading impacts
    across multiple sectors of the economy and society. Improved forecasting of drought
    conditions ahead of time can significantly improve strategic planning to mitigate
    the impacts and enhance resilience. Though significant progress in forecasting
    approaches has been made, the current approaches focus on the overall improvement
    of the forecast, with less attention on the extremeness of drought events. In
    this paper, we focus on improving the accuracy of forecasting extreme and severe
    drought events by introducing a novel loss function Surrogate Quantile and Shape
    loss (SQUASH) that combines weighted quantile loss and dynamic time-warping-based
    shape loss.  We show the effectiveness of the proposed loss functions for imbalanced
    time-series drought forecasting tasks on two regions in India and the USA.

  abstract: The CyGNSS (Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System) satellite system
    measures GNSS signals reflected off the Earth's surface. A global ocean wind speed
    dataset is derived, which fills a gap in Earth observation data, will improve
    cyclone forecasting, and could be used to mitigate effects of climate change.
    We propose CyGNSSnet, a deep learning model for predicting wind speed from CyGNSS
    observables, and evaluate its potential for operational use. With CyGNSSnet, performance
    improves by 29\% over the current operational model. We further introduce a hierarchical
    model, that combines an extreme value classifier and a specialized CyGNSSnet and
    slightly improves predictions for high winds.

- paper_title: Predicting Critical Biogeochemistry of the Southern Ocean for Climate
    Monitoring
  abstract: The Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) program is building a network of globally
    distributed, sensor-equipped robotic profiling floats, improving our understanding
    of the climate system and how it is changing. These floats, however, are limited
    in the number of variables measured. In this study, we train neural networks to
    predict silicate and phosphate values in the Southern Ocean from temperature,
    pressure, salinity, oxygen, nitrate, and location and apply these models to earth
    system model (ESM) and BGC-Argo data to expand the utility of this ocean observation
    network. We trained our neural networks on observations from the Global Ocean
    Ship-Based Hydrographic Investigations Program (GO-SHIP) and use dropout regularization
    to provide uncertainty bounds around our predicted values. Our neural network
    significantly improves upon linear regression but shows variable levels of uncertainty
    across the ranges of predicted variables. We explore the generalization of our
    estimators to test data outside our training distribution from both ESM and BGC-Argo
    data. Our use of out-of-distribution test data to examine shifts in biogeochemical
    parameters and calculate uncertainty bounds around estimates advance the state-of-the-art
    in oceanographic data and climate monitoring. We make our data and code publicly
    available.

- paper_title: On the Generalization of Agricultural Drought Classification from Climate
    Data
  abstract: Climate change is expected to increase the likelihood of drought events,
    with severe implications for food security. Unlike other natural disasters, droughts
    have a slow onset and depend on various external factors, making drought detection
    in climate data difficult.  In contrast to existing works that rely on simple
    relative drought indices as ground-truth data, we build upon soil moisture index
    (SMI) obtained from a hydrological model. This index is directly related to insufficiently
    available water to vegetation. Given ERA5-Land climate input data of six months
    with land use information from MODIS satellite observation, we compare different
    models with and without sequential inductive bias in classifying droughts based
    on SMI. We use PR-AUC as the evaluation measure to account for the class imbalance
    and obtain promising results despite a challenging time-based split. We further
    show in an ablation study that the models retain their predictive capabilities
    given input data of coarser resolutions, as frequently encountered in climate
    models.

- paper_title: Mapping Post-Climate Change Biogeographical Regions with Deep Latent
    Variable Models
  abstract: Forecasting future changes to biodiversity due to shifts in climate is
    challenging due to nonlinear interactions between species as recorded in their
    presence/absence data. This work proposes using variational autoencoders with
    environmental covariates to identify low-dimensional structure in species’ joint
    co-occurrence patterns and leveraging this simplified representation to provide
    multivariate predictions of their habitat extent under future climate scenarios.
    We pursue a latent space clustering approach to map biogeographical regions of
    frequently co-occurring species and apply this methodology to a dataset from northern
    Belgium, generating predictive maps illustrating how these regions may expand
    or contract with changing temperature under a future climate scenario.

  abstract: Deforestation has become a significant contributing factor to climate
    change and, due to this, both classifying the drivers and predicting segmentation
    maps of deforestation has attracted significant interest. In this work, we develop
    a rotation equivariant convolutional neural network model to predict the drivers
    and generate segmentation maps of deforestation events from Landsat 8 satellite
    images. This outperforms previous methods in classifying the drivers and predicting
    the segmentation map of deforestation, offering a 9% improvement in classification
    accuracy and a 7% improvement in segmentation map accuracy. In addition, this
    method predicts stable segmentation maps under rotation of the input image, which
    ensures that predicted regions of deforestation are not dependent upon the rotational
    orientation of the satellite.

- paper_title: 'WiSoSuper: Benchmarking Super-Resolution Methods on Wind and Solar
    Data'
  abstract: The transition to green energy grids depends on detailed wind and solar
    forecasts to optimize the siting and scheduling of renewable energy generation.
    Operational forecasts from numerical weather prediction models, however, only
    have a spatial resolution of 10 to 20-km, which leads to sub-optimal usage and
    development of renewable energy farms. Weather scientists have been developing
    super-resolution methods to increase the resolution, but often rely on simple
    interpolation techniques or computationally expensive differential equation-based
    models. Recently, machine learning-based models, specifically the physics-informed
    resolution-enhancing generative adversarial network (PhIREGAN), have outperformed
    traditional downscaling methods. We provide a thorough and extensible benchmark
    of leading deep learning-based super-resolution techniques, including the enhanced
    super-resolution generative adversarial network (ESRGAN) and an enhanced deep
    super-resolution (EDSR) network, on wind and solar data. We accompany the benchmark
    with a novel public, processed, and machine learning-ready dataset for benchmarking
    super-resolution methods on wind and solar data.

    Models with Multi-Source Data

    do not leverage data collected during previous calibration tasks. In this paper,
    we employ attentive neural processes (ANP) to meta-learn a distribution using

    a meta-learned Bayesian optimizer to accelerate calibration of new, unseen tasks.
    The few-shot nature of our proposed algorithm is demonstrated on a library of

- paper_title: 'SunCast: Solar Irradiance Nowcasting from Geosynchronous Satellite
    Data'
  abstract: When cloud layers cover photovoltaic (PV) panels, the amount of power
    the panels produce fluctuates rapidly. Therefore, to maintain enough energy on
    a power grid to match demand, utilities companies rely on reserve power sources
    that typically come from fossil fuels and therefore pollute the environment. Accurate
    short-term PV power prediction enables operators to maximize the amount of power
    obtained from PV panels and safely reduce the reserve energy needed from fossil
    fuel sources. While several studies have developed machine learning models to
    predict solar irradiance at specific PV generation facilities, little work has
    been done to model short-term solar irradiance on a global scale. Furthermore,
    models that have been developed are proprietary and have architectures that are
    not publicly available or rely on  computationally demanding Numerical Weather
    Prediction (NWP) models. Here, we propose a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory
    Network model that treats solar nowcasting as a next frame prediction problem,
    is more efficient than NWP models and has a straightforward, reproducible architecture.
    Our models can predict solar irradiance for entire North America for up to 3 hours
    in under 60 seconds on a single machine without a GPU and has a RMSE of 120 W/m^2
    when evaluated on 2 months of data.

    Infrastructure Detection in Remotely Sensed Imagery
  abstract: Object detection in remotely sensed data is frequently stymied by applications
    in geographies that are different from that of the training data. When objects
    are rare, the problem is exacerbated further. This is true of assessments of energy
    infrastructure such as generation, transmission, and end-use consumption; key
    to electrification planning as well as for effective assessment of natural disaster
    impacts which are varying in frequency and intensity due to climate change. We
    propose an approach to domain adaptation that requires only unlabeled samples
    from the target domain and generates synthetic data to augment training data for
    targeted domain adaptation. This approach is shown to work consistently across
    four geographically diverse domains, improving object detection average precision
    by 15.5\% on average for small sample sizes.

    How Fires Behave Beyond the Limits of Physics-Based Empirical Models'
  abstract: Wildland fires pose an increasing threat in light of anthropogenic climate
    change. Fire-spread models play an underpinning role in many areas of research
    across this domain, from emergency evacuation to insurance analysis. We study
    paths towards advancing such models through deep reinforcement learning. Aggregating
    21 fire perimeters from the Western United States in 2017, we construct 11-layer
    raster images representing the state of the fire area. A convolution neural network
    based agent is trained offline on one million sub-images to create a generalizable
    baseline for predicting the best action - burn or not burn - given the then-current
    state on a particular fire edge. A series of online, TD(0) Monte Carlo Q-Learning
    based improvements are made with final evaluation conducted on a subset of holdout
    fire perimeters. We examine the performance of the learned agent/model against
    the FARSITE fire-spread model.  We also make available a novel data set and propose
    more informative evaluation metrics for future progress.

- paper_title: Subseasonal Solar Power Forecasting via Deep Sequence Learning
  abstract: To help mitigate climate change, power systems need to integrate renewable
    energy sources, such as solar, at a rapid pace. Widespread integration of solar
    energy into the power system requires major improvements in solar irradiance forecasting,
    in order to reduce the uncertainty associated with solar power output. While recent
    works have addressed short lead-time forecasting (minutes to hours ahead), week(s)-ahead
    and longer forecasts, coupled with uncertainty estimates, will be extremely important
    for storage applications in future power systems. In this work, we propose machine
    learning approaches for these longer lead-times as an important new application
    area in the energy domain. We demonstrate the potential of several deep sequence
    learning techniques for both point predictions and probabilistic predictions at
    these longer lead-times. We compare their performance for subseasonal forecasting
    (forecast lead-times of roughly two weeks) using the SURFRAD data set for 7 stations
    across the U.S. in 2018. The results are encouraging; the deep sequence learning
    methods outperform the current benchmark for machine learning-based probabilistic
    predictions (previously applied at short lead-times in this domain), along with
    relevant baselines.

- paper_title: A Transfer Learning-Based Surrogate Model for Geological Carbon Storage
    with Multi-Fidelity Training Data
  abstract: |-
    Geologic carbon storage (GCS) entails injecting large volumes of carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep geologic
    formations to prevent its release to the atmosphere. Reservoir simulation is widely used in GCS applications to predict subsurface pressure and CO2 saturation. High fidelity numerical models are prohibitively expensive for data assimilation and uncertainty quantification, which require a large number of simulation runs. Deep learning-based surrogate models have shown a great promise to alleviate the high computational cost. However, the training cost is high as thousands of high-fidelity simulations are often necessary for generating the training data. In this work, we explore the use of a transfer learning approach to reduce the training cost. Compared with the surrogate model trained with high-fidelity simulations, our new transfer learning-based model shows comparable accuracy but reduces the training cost by 80%.

    and EO Datasets
  abstract: 'National cropland classification is critical to monitor food security,
    comprehend environmental circumstances and climate change, and participate in
    agricultural policy development. The increasing earth observation datasets, especially
    the free available Sentinel and Landsat, open unprecedented large-scale mapping
    opportunities. However, most applied machine learning techniques have relied on
    substantial training datasets, which are not always available and may be expensive
    to create or collect. Focusing on Japan, this work indicates what kinds of information
    can be extracted from agriculture census information then used for mapping different
    crop types. Different classification approaches of pixel-based and parcel-based
    are compared. Then, the efficient method is used to generate Japan''s first national
    cropland classification with Sentinel-1 C-band and Landsat-8 time series. For
    2015, the overall accuracies for the prefectures range between 71\% and 94\%.
    This national cropland classification map, which particularly succeeds in extracting
    high-precision rice products for the whole of Japan and other classes for different
    prefectures, can be treated as the base map of Japan for future studies related
    to agriculture, environment, and climate change.  '

    Wildland Fire Smoke Detection'
  abstract: The size and frequency of wildland fires in the western United States
    have dramatically increased in recent years. On high fire-risk days, a small fire
    ignition can rapidly grow and get out of control. Early detection of fire ignitions
    from initial smoke can assist response to such fires before they become difficult
    to manage. Past deep learning approaches for wildfire smoke detection have suffered
    from small or unreliable datasets that make it difficult to extrapolate performance
    to real-world scenarios. In this work, we present the Fire Ignition Library (FIgLib),
    a publicly-available dataset of nearly 25,000 labeled wildfire smoke images as
    seen from fixed-view cameras deployed in Southern California. We also introduce
    SmokeyNet, a novel deep learning architecture using spatio-temporal information
    from camera imagery for real-time wildfire smoke detection. When trained on the
    FIgLib dataset, SmokeyNet outperforms comparable baselines. We hope that the availability
    of the FIgLib dataset and the SmokeyNet architecture will inspire further research
    into deep learning methods for wildfire smoke detection, leading to automated
    notification systems to reduce the time to wildfire response.

- paper_title: Multitask Learning for Estimating Power Plant Greenhouse Gas Emissions
    from Satellite Imagery
  abstract: "The burning of fossil fuels produces large amounts of carbon dioxide
    (CO2), a major Greenhouse Gas (GHG) and a main driver of Climate Change. \nQuantifying
    GHG emissions is crucial for accurate predictions of climate effects and to enforce
    emission trading schemes. The reporting of such emissions is only required in
    some countries, resulting in insufficient global coverage.\nIn this work, we propose
    an end-to-end method to predict power generation rates for fossil fuel power plants
    from satellite images based on which we estimate GHG emission rates. We present
    a multitask deep learning approach able to simultaneously predict: (i) the pixel-area
    covered by plumes from a single satellite image of a power plant, (ii) the type
    of fired fuel, and (iii) the power generation rate. We then convert the predicted
    power generation rate into estimates for the rate at which CO2 is being emitted.\nExperimental
    results show that our model approach allows us to estimate the power generation
    rate of a power plant to within 139 MW (MAE, for a mean sample power plant capacity
    of 1177 MW) from a single satellite image and CO2 emission rates to within 311
    t/h. \nThis multitask learning approach improves the power generation estimation
    MAE by 39 % compared to a single-task network trained on the same dataset. "

    in Weather and Climate Models'
  abstract: "Numerical simulations of Earth's weather and climate require substantial
    amounts of computation. This has led to a growing interest in replacing subroutines
    that explicitly compute physical processes with approximate machine learning (ML)
    methods that are fast at inference time. Within weather and climate models, atmospheric
    radiative transfer (RT) calculations are especially expensive. \n  This has made
    them a popular target for neural network-based emulators.  \n  However, prior
    work is hard to compare due to the lack of a comprehensive dataset and standardized
    best practices for ML benchmarking.\n  To fill this gap, we introduce the \\climart
    dataset, with more than \\emph{10 million samples from present, pre-industrial,
    and future climate conditions}.\n ClimART poses several methodological challenges
    for the ML community, such as multiple out-of-distribution test sets, underlying
    domain physics, and a trade-off between accuracy and inference speed.\n  We also
    present several novel baselines that indicate shortcomings of the datasets and
    network architectures used in prior work."

- paper_title: 'A GNN-RNN Approach for Harnessing Geospatial and Temporal Information:
    Application to Crop Yield Prediction'
  abstract: Climate change poses new challenges to agricultural production, as crop
    yields are extremely sensitive to climatic variation. Accurately predicting the
    effects of weather patterns on crop yield is crucial for addressing issues such
    as food insecurity, supply stability, and economic planning. Recently, there have
    been many attempts to use machine learning models for crop yield prediction. However,
    these models either restrict their tasks to a relatively small region or a short
    time-period (e.g. a few years), which makes them hard to generalize spatially
    and temporally. They also view each location as an i.i.d sample, ignoring spatial
    correlations in the data. In this paper, we introduce a novel graph-based recurrent
    neural network for crop yield prediction, which incorporates both geographical
    and temporal structure. Our method is trained, validated, and tested on over 2000
    counties from 41 states in the US mainland, covering years from 1981 to 2019.
    As far as we know, this is the first machine learning method that embeds geographical
    knowledge in crop yield prediction and predicts crop yields at the county level
    nationwide. Experimental results show that our proposed method consistently outperforms
    a wide variety of existing state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
    of geospatial and temporal information.

  abstract: We develop a subseasonal forecasting toolkit of simple learned benchmark
    models that outperform both operational practice and state-of-the-art machine
    learning and deep learning methods. Our new models include (a) Climatology++,
    an adaptive alternative to climatology that, for precipitation, is 9% more accurate
    and 250\% more skillful than the United States operational Climate Forecasting
    System (CFSv2); (b) CFSv2++, a learned CFSv2 correction that improves temperature
    and precipitation accuracy by 7-8% and skill by 50-275%; and (c) Persistence++,
    an augmented persistence model that combines CFSv2 forecasts with lagged measurements
    to improve temperature and precipitation accuracy by 6-9% and skill by 40-130%.
    Across the contiguous U.S., these models consistently outperform standard meteorological
    baselines, state-of-the-art learning methods, and the European Centre for Medium-Range
    Weather Forecasts ensemble. Overall, we find that augmenting traditional forecasting
    approaches with learned enhancements yields an effective and computationally inexpensive
    strategy for building the next generation of subseasonal forecasting benchmarks.

    differentiation
  abstract: We consider a variant of the classical problem of designing or expanding
    an electricity network. Instead of minimizing only investment and production costs,
    however, we seek to minimize some mixture of cost and greenhouse gas emissions,
    even if the underlying dispatch model does not tax emissions. This enables grid
    planners to directly minimize consumption-based emissions, when expanding or modifying
    the grid, regardless of whether or not the carbon market incorporates a carbon
    tax. We solve this problem using gradient descent with implicit differentiation,
    a technique recently popularized in machine learning. To demonstrate the method,
    we optimize transmission and storage resources on the IEEE 14-bus test network
    and compare our solution to one generated by standard planning with a carbon tax.
    Our solution significantly reduces emissions for the same levelized cost of electricity.

- paper_title: Amortized inference of Gaussian process hyperparameters for improved
    concrete strength trajectory prediction
  abstract: Designing and utilizing alternative concrete formulations which supplant
    the use of ordinary portland cement with alternative binders have been identified
    as central goals in reducing the greenhouse gas impact of the concrete industry.
    Given the variability in availability and quality of alternatives, these goals
    call for an optimal design of experiment approach to designing formulations, which
    can be adapted to local needs. The realization of this goal hinges on an ability
    to predict key properties. Here, we present and benchmark a Gaussian process (GP)
    model for predicting the trajectory of concrete strength, an essential performance
    measure. GPs are a desirable model class for the application because of their
    ability to estimate uncertainty and update predictions given additional data.
    In this work, rather than manually tuning hyperparameters for different concrete
    mix models, we propose a new method based on amortized inference leveraging mixture
    attributes, leading to models which are better fit for use in Bayesian optimization
    of concrete formulation. We demonstrate the success of the approach using a large,
    industrial concrete dataset.

    and early detection of harmful algal blooms
  abstract: Climate change is making oceans warmer and more acidic. Under these conditions
    phytoplankton can produce harmful algal blooms which cause rapid oxygen depletion
    and consequent death of marine plants and animals. Some species are even capable
    of releasing toxic substances endangering water quality and human health. Monitoring
    of phytoplankton and early detection of harmful algal blooms is essential for
    protection of marine flaura and fauna. Recent technological advances have enabled
    in-situ plankton image capture in real-time at low cost. However, available phytoplankton
    image databases have several limitations that prevent the practical usage of artificial
    intelligent models. We present a pipeline for integration of heterogeneous phytoplankton
    image datasets from around the world into a unified database that can ultimately
    serve as a benchmark dataset for phytoplankton research and therefore act as an
    important tool in building versatile machine learning models for climate adaptation
    planning. A machine learning model for early detection of harmful algal blooms
    is part of ongoing work.

    to Rapid Intensification in Tropical Cyclones
  abstract: Tropical cyclone (TC) intensity forecasts are issued by human forecasters
    who evaluate spatio-temporal observations (e.g., satellite imagery) and model
    output (e.g., numerical weather prediction, statistical models) to produce  forecasts
    every 6 hours. Within these time constraints, it can be challenging to draw insight
    from such data. While high-capacity machine learning methods are well suited for
    prediction problems with complex sequence data, extracting interpretable scientific
    information with such methods is difficult. Here we leverage powerful AI prediction
    algorithms and classical statistical inference to identify patterns in the evolution
    of TC convective structure leading up to the rapid intensification of a storm,
    hence providing forecasters and scientists with key insight into TC behavior.

- paper_title: Predicting Atlantic Multidecadal Variability
  abstract: Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) describes variations of North
    Atlantic sea surface temperature with a typical cycle of between 60 and 70 years.
    AMV strongly impacts local climate over North America and Europe, therefore prediction
    of AMV, especially the extreme values, is of great societal utility for understanding
    and responding to regional climate change. This work tests multiple machine learning
    models to improve the state of AMV prediction from maps of sea surface temperature,
    salinity, and sea level pressure in the North Atlantic region. We use data from
    the Community Earth System Model 1 Large Ensemble Project, a state-of-the-art
    climate model with 3,440 years of data. Our results demonstrate that all of the
    models we use outperform the traditional persistence forecast baseline. Predicting

- paper_title: Identifying the atmospheric drivers of drought and heat using a smoothed
    deep learning approach
  abstract: Europe was hit by several, disastrous heat and drought events in recent
    summers. Besides thermodynamic influences, such hot and dry extremes are driven
    by certain atmospheric situations including anticyclonic conditions. Effects of
    climate change on atmospheric circulations are complex and many open research
    questions remain in this context, e.g., on future trends of anticyclonic conditions.
    Based on the combination of a catalog of labeled circulation patterns and spatial
    atmospheric variables, we propose a smoothed convolutional neural network classifier
    for six types of anticyclonic circulations that are associated with drought and
    heat. Our work can help to identify important drivers of hot and dry extremes
    in climate simulations, which allows to unveil the impact of climate change on
    these drivers. We address various challenges inherent to circulation pattern classification
    that are also present in other climate patterns, e.g., subjective labels and unambiguous
    transition periods.

- paper_title: Learning to identify cracks on wind turbine blade surfaces using drone-based
    inspection images
  abstract: "Wind energy is expected to be one of the leading ways to achieve the
    goals of\nthe Paris Agreement but it in turn heavily depends on effective management
    of its\noperations and maintenance (O&M) costs. Blade failures account for one-third\nof
    all O&M costs thus making accurate detection of blade damages, especially\ncracks,
    very important for sustained operations and cost savings. Traditionally,\ndamage
    inspection has been a completely manual process thus making it subjective, error-prone,
    and time-consuming. \nHence in this work, we bring more objectivity, scalability,
    and repeatability in our damage inspection process, using deep learning, to miss
    fewer cracks. We build a deep learning model trained on a large dataset of blade
    damages, collected by our drone-based inspection, to correctly detect cracks.
    Our model is already in production and has processed more than a million damages
    with a recall of 0.96. We also focus on model interpretability using class activation
    maps to get a peek into the model workings. The model not only performs as good\nas
    human experts but also better in certain tricky cases. \nThus, in this work, we
    aim to increase wind energy adoption by decreasing one of its major hurdles -
    the O&M costs resulting from missing blade failures like cracks."

- paper_title: Evaluating Pretraining Methods for Deep Learning on Geophysical Imaging
    Datasets
  abstract: Machine learning has the potential to automate the analysis of vast amounts
    of raw geophysical data, allowing scientists to monitor changes in key aspects
    of our climate such as cloud cover in real-time and at fine spatiotemporal scales.
    However, the lack of large labeled training datasets poses a significant barrier
    for effectively applying machine learning to these applications. Transfer learning,
    which involves first pretraining a neural network on an auxiliary “source” dataset
    and then finetuning on the “target” dataset, has been shown to improve accuracy
    for machine learning models trained on small datasets. Across prior work on machine
    learning for geophysical imaging, different choices are made about what data to
    pretrain on, and the impact of these choices on model performance is unclear.
    To address this, we systematically explore various settings of transfer learning
    for cloud classification, cloud segmentation, and aurora classification. We pretrain
    on different source datasets, including the large ImageNet dataset as well as
    smaller geophysical datasets that are more similar to the target datasets. We
    also experiment with multiple transfer learning steps where we pretrain on more
    than one source dataset. Despite the smaller source datasets’ similarity to the
    target datasets, we find that pretraining on the large, general-purpose ImageNet
    dataset yields significantly better results across all of our experiments. Transfer
    learning is especially effective for smaller target datasets, and in these cases,
    using multiple source datasets can give a marginal added benefit.

- paper_title: An Automated System for Detecting Visual Damages of Wind Turbine Blades
  abstract: |-
    Wind energy’s ability to compete with fossil fuels on a market level depends on
    lowering wind’s high operational costs. Since damages on wind turbine blades
    are the leading cause for these operational problems, identifying blade damages
    is critical. However, recent works in visual identification of blade damages are
    still experimental and focus on optimizing the traditional machine learning metrics
    such as IoU. In this paper, we argue that pushing models to production long before
    achieving the "optimal" model performance can still generate real value for this
    use case. We discuss the performance of Blue, our damage’s suggestion model in
    production and how this system works in coordination with humans as part of a
    commercialized product and how it can contribute towards lowering wind energy’s
    operational costs.

- paper_title: 'Predicting Power System Dynamics and Transients: A Frequency Domain
    Approach'
  abstract: |-
    With the ambition of reducing carbon emissions and mitigating climate change, many regions have set up the goal to generate electricity with close to 100% renewables. However, actual renewable generations are often curtailed by operators because it is too hard to check the dynamic stability of the electric grid under the high uncertainties introduced by the renewables. The dynamics of a power grid are governed by a large number of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). To safely operate the system, operators need to check that the states described by this set of ODEs stay within prescribed limits after various potential faults.  Limited by the size and stiffness of the ODEs, current numerical integration techniques are often too slow to be useful in real-time or large-scale resource allocation problems. In addition, detailed system parameters are often not exactly known. Machine learning approaches have been proposed to reduce the computational efforts, but existing methods generally suffer from overfitting and failures to predict unstable behaviors.


    This paper proposes a novel framework for power system dynamic predictions by learning in the frequency domain. The intuition is that although the system behavior is complex in the time domain, there are relatively few dominate modes in the frequency domain. Therefore, we learn to predict by constructing neural networks with Fourier transform and filtering layers. System topology and fault information are encoded by taking a multi-dimensional Fourier transform, allowing us to leverage the fact that the trajectories are sparse both in time and spatial (across different buses) frequencies. We show that the proposed approach does not need detailed system parameters, speeds up prediction computations by orders of magnitude and is highly accurate for different fault types.

- paper_title: 'HyperionSolarNet: Solar Panel Detection from Aerial Images'
  abstract: With the effects of global climate change impacting the world, collective
    efforts are needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The energy sector is the
    single largest contributor to climate change and many efforts are focused on reducing
    dependence on carbon-emitting power plants and moving to renewable energy sources,
    such as solar power. A comprehensive database of the location of solar panels
    is important to assist analysts and policymakers in defining strategies for further
    expansion of solar energy. In this paper we focus on creating a world map of solar
    panels. We identify locations and total surface area of solar panels within a
    given geographic area. We use deep learning methods for automated detection of
    solar panel locations and their surface area using aerial imagery. The framework,
    which consists of a two-branch model using an image classifier in tandem with
    a semantic segmentation model, is trained on our created dataset of satellite
    images. Our work provides an efficient and scalable method for detecting solar
    panels, achieving an accuracy of 0.96 for classification and an IoU score of 0.82
    for segmentation performance.

- paper_title: Prediction of Household-level Heat-Consumption using PSO enhanced SVR
    Model
  abstract: In combating climate change, an effective demand-based energy supply operation
    of the district energy system (DES) for heating or cooling is indispensable. As
    a consequence, an accurate forecast of heat consumption on the consumer side poses
    an important first step towards an optimal energy supply. However, due to the
    non-linearity and non-stationarity of heat consumption data, the prediction of
    the thermal energy demand of DES remains challenging. In this work, we propose
    a forecasting framework for thermal energy consumption within a district heating
    system (DHS) based on kernel Support Vector Regression (kSVR) using real-world
    smart meter data. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is employed to find the optimal
    hyper-parameter for the kSVR model which leads to the superiority of the proposed
    methods when compared to a state-of-the-art ARIMA model. The average MAPE is reduced
    to 2.07% and 2.64% for the individual meter-specific forecasting and for forecasting
    of societal consumption, respectively.

    Traffic Signal Control'
  abstract: Mobility, the environment, and human health are all harmed by sub-optimal
    control policies in transportation systems. Intersection traffic signal controllers
    are a crucial part of today's transportation infrastructure, as sub-optimal policies
    may lead to traffic jams and as a result increased levels of air pollution and
    wasted time. Many adaptive traffic signal controllers have been proposed in the
    literature, but research on their relative performance differences is limited.
    On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge there has been no work that directly
    targets CO2 emission reduction, even though pollution is currently a critical
    issue. In this paper, we propose a reward shaping scheme for various RL algorithms
    that not only produces lowers CO2 emissions, but also produces respectable outcomes
    in terms of other metrics such as travel time. We compare multiple RL algorithms
    ---  sarsa, and A2C ---  as well as diverse scenarios with a mix of different
    road users emitting varied amounts of pollution.

    if machine learning techniques could help to understand and anticipate hypoxic
    episodes in nutrient-impacted estuaries, a phenomenon that is exacerbated by increasing
    temperature expected to arise due to changes in climate. A major constraint was
    to limit ourselves to the use of dissolved oxygen time series only. Our preliminary

- paper_title: Decentralized Safe Reinforcement Learning for Voltage Control
  abstract: |-
    Inverter-based distributed energy resources provide the possibility for fast time-scale voltage control by quickly adjusting their reactive power. The power-electronic interfaces allow these resources to realize almost arbitrary control law, but designing these decentralized controllers is nontrivial. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches are becoming increasingly popular to search for policy parameterized by neural networks. It is difficult, however, to enforce that the learned controllers are safe, in the sense that they may introduce instabilities into the system.


    This paper proposes a safe learning approach for voltage control. We prove that the system is guaranteed to be exponentially stable if each controller satisfies certain Lipschitz constraints. The set of Lipschitz bound is optimized to enlarge the search space for neural network controllers. We explicitly engineer the structure of neural network controllers such that they satisfy the Lipschitz constraints by design. A decentralized RL framework is constructed to train local neural network controller at each bus in a model-free setting.

- paper_title: High-resolution rainfall-runoff modeling using graph neural network
  abstract: Time-series modeling has shown great promise in recent studies using the
    latest deep learning algorithms such as LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). These studies
    primarily focused on watershed-scale rainfall-runoff modeling or streamflow forecasting,
    but the majority of them only considered a single watershed as a unit. Although
    this simplification is very effective, it does not take into account spatial information,
    which could result in significant errors in large watersheds. Several studies
    investigated the use of GNN (Graph Neural Networks) for data integration by decomposing
    a large watershed into multiple sub-watersheds, but each sub-watershed is still
    treated as a whole, and the geoinformation contained within the watershed is not
    fully utilized. In this paper, we propose the GNRRM (Graph Neural Rainfall-Runoff
    Model), a novel deep learning model that makes full use of spatial information
    from high-resolution precipitation data, including flow direction and geographic
    information. When compared to baseline models, GNRRM has less over-fitting and
    significantly improves model performance. Our findings support the importance
    of hydrological data in deep learning-based rainfall-runoff modeling, and we encourage
    researchers to include more domain knowledge in their models.

- paper_title: Machine Learning for Snow Stratigraphy Classification
  abstract: Snow-layer segmentation and classification is an essential diagnostic
    task for a wide variety of cryospheric science and climate research applications.
    To this end a Snow Micro Pen (SMP) can be used - a portable high-resolution snow
    penetrometer. However, the penetration-force measurements of the SMP must be labeled
    manually, which is a time-intensive task that requires training and becomes infeasible
    for large datasets. Here, we evaluate how well machine learning models can automatically
    segment and classify SMP profiles. Fourteen different models are trained on the
    MOSAiC SMP dataset, a unique and large SMP dataset of snow on Arctic sea-ice profiles.
    Depending on the user's task and needs, the long short-term memory neural network
    and the random forests are performing the best. The findings presented here facilitate
    and accelerate SMP data analysis and in consequence, help scientists to analyze
    the effects of climate change on the cryosphere more efficiently.

- paper_title: DEM Super-Resolution with EfficientNetV2
  abstract: Efficient climate change monitoring and modeling rely on high-quality
    geospatial and environmental datasets. Due to limitations in technical capabilities
    or resources, the acquisition of high-quality data for many environmental disciplines
    is costly. Digital Elevation Model (DEM) datasets are such examples whereas their
    low-resolution versions are widely available, high-resolution ones are scarce.
    In an effort to rectify this problem, we propose and assess an EfficientNetV2
    based model. The proposed model increases the spatial resolution of DEMs up to
    16 times without additional information.

- paper_title: Learning to Dissipate Traffic Jams with Piecewise Constant Control
  abstract: Greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly carbon dioxide, are a key contributor
    to climate change. The transportation sector makes up 35% of CO2 emissions in
    the US and more than 70% of it is due to land transport. Previous work shows that
    simple driving interventions have the ability to significantly improve traffic
    flow on the road. Recent work shows that 5% of vehicles using piecewise constant
    controllers, designed to be compatible to the reaction times of human drivers,
    can prevent the formation of stop-and-go traffic congestion on a single-lane circular
    track, thereby mitigating land transportation emissions. Our work extends these
    results to consider more extreme traffic settings, where traffic jams have already
    formed, and environments with limited cooperation. We show that even with the
    added realism of these challenges, piecewise constant controllers, trained using
    deep reinforcement learning, can essentially eliminate stop-and-go traffic when
    actions are held fixed for up to 5 seconds. Even up to 10-second action holds,
    such controllers show congestion benefits over a human driving baseline. These
    findings are a stepping-stone for near-term deployment of vehicle-based congestion
    mitigation.

- paper_title: Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning Controller for Multi-Generator
    Industrial Wave Energy Converter
  abstract: Waves are one of the greatest sources of renewable energy and are a promising
    resource to tackle climate challenges by decarbonizing energy generation. Lowering
    the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) for wave energy converters is key to competitiveness
    with other forms of clean energy like wind and solar. Also, the complexity of
    control has gone up significantly with the state-of-the-art multi-generator multi-legged
    industrial Wave Energy Converters (WEC). This paper introduces a Multi-Agent Reinforcement
    Learning controller (MARL) architecture that can handle these multiple objectives
    for LCOE, helping the increase in energy capture efficiency, boosting revenue,
    reducing structural stress to limit maintenance and operating cost, and adaptively
    and proactively protect the wave energy converter from catastrophic weather events,
    preserving investments and lowering effective capital cost. We use a MARL implementing
    proximal policy optimization (PPO) with various optimizations to help sustain
    the training convergence in the complex hyperplane. The MARL is able to better
    control the reactive forces of the generators on multiple tethers (legs) of WEC
    than the commonly deployed spring damper controller. The design for trust is implemented
    to assure the operation of WEC within a safe zone of mechanical compliance and
    guarantee mechanical integrity. This is achieved through reward shaping for multiple
    objectives of energy capture and penalty for harmful motions to minimize stress
    and lower the cost of maintenance. We achieved double-digit gains in energy capture
    efficiency across the waves of different principal frequencies over the baseline
    Spring Damper controller with the proposed MARL controllers.

- paper_title: Resolving Super Fine-Resolution SIF via Coarsely-Supervised U-Net Regression
  abstract: Climate change presents challenges to crop productivity, such as increasing
    the likelihood of heat stress and  drought. Solar-Induced Chlorophyll Fluorescence
    (SIF) is a powerful way to monitor how crop productivity and photosynthesis are
    affected by changing climatic conditions. However, satellite SIF observations
    are only available at a coarse spatial resolution (e.g. 3-5km) in most places,
    making it difficult to determine how individual crop types or farms are doing.
    This poses a challenging coarsely-supervised regression task; at training time,
    we only have access to SIF labels at a coarse resolution (3 km), yet we want to
    predict SIF at a very fine spatial resolution (30 meters), a 100x increase. We
    do have some fine-resolution input features (such as Landsat reflectance) that
    are correlated with SIF, but the nature of the correlation is unknown. To address
    this, we propose Coarsely-Supervised Regression U-Net (CSR-U-Net), a novel approach
    to train a U-Net for this coarse supervision setting. CSR-U-Net takes in a fine-resolution
    input image, and outputs a SIF prediction for each pixel; the average of the pixel
    predictions is trained to equal the true coarse-resolution SIF for the entire
    image. Even though this is a very weak form of supervision, CSR-U-Net can still
    learn to predict accurately, due to its inherent localization abilities, plus
    additional enhancements that facilitate the incorporation of scientific prior
    knowledge. CSR-U-Net can resolve fine-grained variations in SIF more accurately
    than existing averaging-based approaches, which ignore fine-resolution spatial
    variation during training. CSR-U-Net could also be useful for a wide range of
    "downscaling'" problems in climate science, such as increasing the resolution
    of global climate models.

- paper_title: 'PreDisM: Pre-Disaster Modelling With CNN Ensembles for At-Risk Communities'
  abstract: The machine learning community has recently had increased interest in
    the climate and disaster damage domain due to a marked increased occurrences of
    natural hazards (e.g., hurricanes, forest fires, floods, earthquakes). However,
    not enough attention has been devoted to mitigating probable destruction from
    impending natural hazards. We explore this crucial space by predicting building-level
    damages on a before-the-fact basis that would allow state actors and non-governmental
    organizations to be best equipped with resource distribution to minimize or preempt
    losses. We introduce PreDisM that employs an ensemble of ResNets and fully connected
    layers over decision trees to capture image-level and meta-level information to
    accurately estimate weakness of man-made structures to disaster-occurrences. Our
    model performs well and is responsive to tuning across types of disasters and
    highlights the space of preemptive hazard damage modelling.

- paper_title: A hybrid convolutional neural network/active contour approach to segmenting
    dead trees in aerial imagery
  abstract: |-
    The stability and ability of an ecosystem to withstand climate change is directly
    linked to its biodiversity. Dead trees are a key indicator of overall forest health, housing one-third of forest ecosystem biodiversity, and constitute 8% of the global carbon stocks. They are decomposed by several natural factors, e.g. climate, insects and fungi. Accurate detection and modeling of dead wood mass is paramount to understanding forest ecology, the carbon cycle and decomposers. We present a novel method to construct precise shape contours of dead trees from aerial photographs by combining established convolutional neural networks with a novel active contour model in an energy minimization framework. Our approach yields superior performance accuracy over state-of-the-art in terms of precision, recall, and intersection over union of detected dead trees. This improved performance is essential to meet emerging challenges caused by climate change (and other man-made perturbations to the systems), particularly to monitor and estimate carbon stock decay rates, monitor forest health and biodiversity, and the overall effects of dead wood on and from climate change.

- paper_title: Semi-Supervised Classification and Segmentation on High Resolution
    Aerial Images
  abstract: FloodNet is a high-resolution image dataset acquired by a small UAV platform,
    DJI Mavic Pro quadcopters, after Hurricane Harvey. The dataset presents a unique
    challenge of advancing the damage assessment process for post-disaster scenarios
    using unlabeled and limited labeled dataset. We propose a solution to address
    their classification and semantic segmentation challenge. We approach this problem
    by generating pseudo labels for both classification and segmentation during training
    and slowly incrementing the amount by which the pseudo label loss affects the
    final loss. Using this semi-supervised method of training helped us improve our
    baseline supervised loss by a huge margin for classification, allowing the model
    to generalize and perform better on the validation and test splits of the dataset.
    In this paper, we compare and contrast the various methods and models for image
    classification and semantic segmentation on the FloodNet dataset.

- paper_title: Reducing the Barriers of Acquiring Ground-truth from Biodiversity Rich
    Audio Datasets Using Intelligent Sampling Techniques
  abstract: The potential of passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) as a method to reveal
    the consequences of climate change on the biodiversity that make up natural soundscapes
    can be undermined by the discrepancy between the low barrier of entry to acquire
    large field audio datasets and the higher barrier of acquiring reliable species
    level training, validation, and test subsets from the field audio. These subsets
    from a deployment are often required to verify any machine learning models used
    to assist researchers in understanding the local biodiversity. Especially as many
    models convey promising results from various sources that may not translate to
    the collected field audio. Labeling such datasets is a resource intensive process
    due to the lack of experts capable of identifying bioacoustics at a species level
    as well as the overwhelming size of many PAM audiosets. To address this challenge,
    we have tested different sampling techniques on an audio dataset collected over
    a two-week long August audio array deployment on the Scripps Coastal Reserve (SCR)
    Biodiversity Trail in La Jolla, California. These sampling techniques involve
    creating four subsets using stratified random sampling, limiting samples to the
    daily bird vocalization peaks, and using a hybrid convolutional neural network
    (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) trained for bird presence/absence audio
    classification. We found that a stratified random sample baseline only achieved
    a bird presence rate of 44% in contrast with a sample that randomly selected clips
    with high hybrid CNN-RNN predictions that were collected during bird activity
    peaks at dawn and dusk yielding a bird presence rate of 95%. The significantly
    higher bird presence rate demonstrates how intelligent, machine learning-assisted
    selection of audio data can significantly reduce the amount of time that domain
    experts listen to audio without vocalizations of interest while building a ground
    truth for machine learning models.

    classification with CNNs
  abstract: "By leveraging deep learning to automatically classify camera trap images,
    ecologists can monitor biodiversity conservation efforts and the effects of climate
    change on ecosystems more efficiently.  \nDue to the imbalanced class-distribution
    of camera trap datasets, current models are biased towards the majority classes.
    \nAs a result, they obtain good performance for a few majority classes but poor
    performance for many minority classes.\nWe used two-phase training to increase
    the performance for these minority classes. \nWe trained, next to a baseline model,
    four models that implemented a different versions of two-phase training on a subset
    of the highly imbalanced Snapshot Serengeti dataset. \nOur results suggest that
    two-phase training can improve performance for many minority classes, with limited
    loss in performance for the other classes. \nWe find that two-phase training based
    on majority undersampling increases class-specific F1-scores up to 3.0%. \nWe
    also find that two-phase training outperforms using only oversampling or undersampling
    by 6.1% in F1-score on average. Finally, we find that a combination of over- and
    undersampling leads to a better performance than using them individually."

- paper_title: Capturing Electricity Market Dynamics in the Optimal Trading of Strategic
    Agents using Neural Network Constrained Optimization
  abstract: In competitive electricity markets the optimal trading problem of an electricity
    market agent is commonly formulated as a bi-level program, and solved as mathematical
    program with equilibrium constraints (MPEC). In this paper, an alternative paradigm,
    labeled as mathematical program with neural network constraint (MPNNC), is developed
    to incorporate complex market dynamics in the optimal bidding strategy. This method
    uses input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to represent the mapping between the
    upper-level (agent) decisions and the lower-level (market) outcomes, i.e., to
    replace the lower-level problem by a neural network. In a comparative analysis,
    the optimal bidding problem of a load agent is formulated via the proposed MPNNC
    and via the classical bi-level programming method, and compared against each other.

- paper_title: Leveraging Machine Learning to Predict the Autoconversion Rates from
    Satellite Data
  abstract: One way of reducing the uncertainty involved in determining the radiative
    forcing of climate change is by understanding the interaction between aerosols,
    clouds, and precipitation processes. This can be studied using high-resolution
    simulations such as the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic Large-Eddy Model (ICON-LEM).
    However, due to the extremely high computational cost required, this simulation-based
    approach can only be run for a limited amount of time within a limited area. To
    address this, we developed new models using emerging machine learning approaches
    that leverage a plethora of satellite observations providing long-term global
    spatial coverage. In particular, our machine learning models are capable of capturing
    the key process of precipitation formation which greatly control cloud lifetime,
    namely autoconversion rates -- the term used to describe the collision and coalescence
    of cloud droplets responsible for raindrop formation. We validate the performance
    of our models against simulation data, showing that our models are capable of
    predicting the autoconversion rates fairly well.

- paper_title: Towards Automatic Transformer-based Cloud Classification and Segmentation
  abstract: Clouds have been demonstrated to have a huge impact on the energy balance,
    temperature, and weather of the Earth. Classification and segmentation of clouds
    and coverage factors is crucial for climate modelling, meteorological studies,
    solar energy industry, and satellite communication. For example, clouds have a
    tremendous impact on short-term predictions or 'nowcasts' of solar irradiance
    and can be used to optimize solar power plants and effectively exploit solar energy.
    However even today, cloud observation requires the intervention of highly-trained
    professionals to document their findings, which introduces bias. To overcome these
    issues and contribute to climate change technology, we propose, to the best of
    our knowledge, the first two transformer-based models applied to cloud data tasks.
    We use the CCSD Cloud classification dataset and achieve 90.06% accuracy, outperforming
    all other methods. To demonstrate the robustness of transformers in this domain,
    we perform Cloud segmentation on SWIMSWG dataset and achieve 83.2% IoU, also outperforming
    other methods. With this, we signal a potential shift away from pure CNN networks.

  abstract: Coastal flooding is a significant climate hazard with impacts across economic
    sectors and society. This study provides a proof of concept for data-driven models
    for coastal flood inundation at the country scale, incorporating storm dynamics
    and geospatial characteristics to improve upon simpler geomorphological models.
    The best fit machine learning model scores an AUC of 0.92 in predicting flooded
    locations. For a case study storm event in December 2013 we find that all models
    over-predict flood extents, but that the machine learning model extents were closest
    to those observed.

- paper_title: Machine Learning in Automating Carbon Sequestration Site Assessment
  abstract: Carbon capture and sequestration are viewed as an indispensable component
    to achieve the Paris Agreement climate goal, i.e., keep the global warming within
    2 degrees Celsius from pre-industrial levels. Once captured, most CO2 needs to
    be stored securely for at least decades, preferably in deep underground geological
    formations. It is economical to inject and store CO2 near/around a depleted gas/oil
    reservoir or well, where a geological trap for CO2 with good sealing properties
    and some minimum infrastructure exist. In this proposal, with our preliminary
    work, it is shown that Machine Learning tools like Optical Character Recognition
    and Natural Language Processing can aid in screening and selection of injection
    sites for CO2 storage, facilitate identification of possible CO2 leakage paths
    in the subsurface, and assist in locating a depleted gas/oil well suitable for
    CO2 injection and long-term storage. The automated process based on ML tools can
    also drastically decrease the decision-making cycle time in site selection and
    assessment phase by reducing human effort. In the longer term, we expect ML tools
    like Deep Neural Networks to be utilized in CO2 storage monitoring, injection
    optimization etc. By injecting CO2 into a trapping geological underground formation
    in a safe and sustainable manner, the Energy industry can contribute substantially
    to reducing global warming and achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement by the
    end of this century.

    water storage
  abstract: 'Subsurface water storage (SWS) is a key variable of the climate system
    and a storage component for precipitation and radiation anomalies, inducing persistence
    in the climate system. It plays a critical role in climate-change projections
    and can mitigate the impacts of climate change on ecosystems. However, because
    of the difficult accessibility of the underground, hydrologic properties and dynamics
    of SWS are poorly known. Direct observations of SWS are limited, and accurate
    incorporation of SWS dynamics into Earth system land models remains challenging.
    We propose a machine learning-enabled model-data integration framework to improve
    the SWS prediction at local to conus scales in a changing climate by leveraging
    all the available observation and simulation resources, as well as to inform the
    model development and guide the observation collection. The accurate prediction
    will enable an optimal decision of water management and land use and improve the
    ecosystem''s resilience to the climate change. '

    for lithium-ion battery degradation diagnosis and prognosis
  abstract: Advancing lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) in both design and usage is key
    to promoting electrification in the coming decades to mitigate human-caused climate
    change. Inadequate understanding of LIB degradation is an important bottleneck
    that limits battery durability and safety. Here, we propose hybrid physics-based
    and data-driven modeling for online diagnosis and prognosis of battery degradation.
    Compared to existing battery modeling efforts, we aim to build a model with physics
    as its backbone and statistical learning techniques as enhancements. Such a hybrid
    model has better generalizability and interpretability together with a well-calibrated
    uncertainty associated with its prediction, rendering it more valuable and relevant
    to safety-critical applications under realistic usage scenarios.

- paper_title: On the use of Deep Generative Models for "Perfect'" Prognosis Climate
    Downscaling
  abstract: Deep Learning has recently emerged as a "perfect" prognosis downscaling
    technique to compute high-resolution fields from large-scale coarse atmospheric
    data. Despite their promising results to reproduce the observed local variability,
    they are based on the estimation of independent distributions at each location,
    which leads to deficient spatial structures, especially when downscaling precipitation.
    This study proposes the use of generative models to improve the spatial consistency
    of the high-resolution fields, very demanded by some sectoral applications (e.g.,
    hydrology) to tackle climate change.

    for Forest Environmental Services (PES)
  abstract: 'Deforestation accounts for more than 20% of global emission. Payments
    for Environmental Services (PES) is seen by both policy makers and practitioners
    as an effective market-based instrument to provide financial incentives for forest
    owners, particularly poor and indigenous households in developing countries. It
    is a critical instrument to protect forests, and ultimately to mitigate climate
    change and reduce emission from deforestation. However, previous studies have
    pointed out a key challenge for PES is to ensure transparent payment to local
    people, due to i) weak monitoring and evaluation and ii) indigenous inaccessibility
    to e-banking and complying with procedural and administrative paper works to receive
    payments. Specifically, the amount and the complexity of forms along with the
    language barriers is a key issue; and most transactions need several intermediaries
    and transaction costs which reduce the payments reaching landowners. To address
    these issues, we propose a communication platform that links across the stakeholders
    and processes. Our proposal will utilize Machine Learning techniques to lower
    the language barrier and provide technology solutions to help indigenous people
    to access payments. This would also help improve the effectiveness and transparency
    of PES schemes. Specifically, we propose the use of Natural Language Processing
    techniques in providing a speech-to-text and auto translation capability, and
    the use of Graph Neural Network to provide link predictions of transaction types,
    volumes and values. The pathway to impact will be forest protection and local
    livelihood through providing financial incentives, and subsequently contribution
    to more carbon sequestration and storage – a key issue in climate change mitigation.

    Risk Disclosures with Material Risks and Metrics
  abstract: "The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) establishes standards
    to guide the disclosures of material sustainability and ESG (Environment, Social,
    Governance)-related information across industries. The availability of quality,
    comparable and decision-useful information is required to assess risks and opportunities
    later integrated into financial decision-making. Particularly, standardized, industry-specific
    climate risk metrics and topics can support these efforts. SASB’s latest climate
    risk technical bulletin introduces three climate-related risks that are financially
    material - physical, transition and regulatory risks - and maps these across industries.
    \nThe main objective of this work is to create a framework that can analyze climate
    related risk disclosures using an AI-based tool that automatically extracts and
    categorizes climate-related risks and related metrics from company disclosures
    based on SASB’s latest climate risk guidance. This process will help with automating
    large-scale analysis and add much-needed transparency vis-a-vis the current state
    of climate-related disclosures, while also assessing how far along companies are
    currently disclosing information on climate risks relevant to their industry.
    As it stands, this much needed type of analysis is made mostly manually or using
    third-party metrics, often opaque and biased, as proxies. In this work, we will
    first create a climate risk glossary that will be trained on a large amount of
    climate risk text. By combining climate risk keywords in this glossary with recent
    advances in natural language processing (NLP), we will then be able to quantitatively
    and qualitatively compare climate risk information in different sectors and industries
    using a novel climate risk score that will be based on SASB standards."

    analyzing methane leaks'
  abstract: 'Methane is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, with the global oil
    and gas industry being the second largest source of anthropogenic methane emissions,
    accounting for about 63% of the whole energy sector.  This underscores the importance
    of detecting and remediating methane leaks for the entire oil and gas value chain.
    Methane sensor networks are a promising technology to detect methane leaks in
    a timely manner. While they provide near-real-time monitoring of an area of interest,
    the density of the network can be cost prohibitive, and the identification of
    the source of the leak is not apparent, especially where there could be more than
    one source. To address these issues, we developed a machine learning framework
    that leverages various data sources including oil and gas facilities data, historical
    methane leak rate distribution and meteorological data, to optimize sensor placement.
    The determination of sensor locations follows the objective to maximize the detection
    of possible methane leaks with a limited sensor budget. '

    electric power grid
  abstract: 'As part of the fight against climate change, the electric power system
    is transitioning from fuel-burning generators to renewable sources of power like
    wind and solar. To allow for the grid to rely heavily on renewables, important
    operational changes must be done. For example, novel approaches for frequency
    regulation, i.e., for balancing in real-time demand and generation, are required
    to ensure the stability of a renewable electric system. Demand response programs
    in which loads adjust in part their power consumption for the grid''s benefit,
    can be used to provide frequency regulation. In this proposal, we present and
    motivate a collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning approach to meet the
    algorithmic requirements for providing real-time power balancing with demand response. '

    Change Benchmark'
  abstract: 'Recent progress in self-supervision shows that pre-training large neural
    networks on vast amounts of unsupervised data can lead to impressive increases
    in generalisation for downstream tasks. Such models, recently coined as foundation
    models, have been transformational to the field of natural language processing.
    While similar models have also been trained on large corpuses of images, they
    are not well suited for remote sensing data. To stimulate the development of foundation
    models for Earth monitoring, we propose to develop a new benchmark comprised of
    a variety of downstream tasks related to climate change. We believe that this
    can lead to substantial improvements in many existing applications and facilitate
    the development of new applications. This proposal is also a call for collaboration
    with the aim of developing a better evaluation process to mitigate potential downsides
    of foundation models for Earth monitoring. '

- paper_title: Optimization of Agricultural Management for SoilCarbon Sequestration
    based on Deep ReinforcementLearning and Large-Scale Simulations
  abstract: Soil carbon sequestration in croplands has tremendous potential to help
    mitigate climate change; however, it is challenging to develop the optimal management
    practices for maximization of the sequestered carbon as well as the crop yield.
    This project aims to develop an intelligent agricultural management system using
    deep reinforcement learning (RL) and large-scale soil and crop simulations. To
    achieve this, we propose to build a simulator to model and simulate the complex
    soil-water-plant-atmosphere interaction. By formulating the management decision
    as an RL problem, we can leverage the state-of-the-art algorithms to train management
    policies through extensive interactions with the simulated environment. The trained
    policies are expected to maximize the stored organic carbon while maximizing the
    crop yield in the presence of uncertain weather conditions. The whole system will
    be tested using data of soil and crops in both mid-west of the United States and
    the central region of Portugal. The proposed research will impact food security
    and climate change, two of the most significant challenges currently facing humanity.

- paper_title: Leveraging machine learning for identify hydrological extreme events
    under global climate change
  abstract: |-
    Hydrological extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are highly destructive  natural disasters and its occurrence is expected to increase under the future climate change. Accurate and efficient approach to detect such events will provide timely information to assist management strategies for minimizing socio-economic damages. Despite the threshold approach has established to detect extreme events, the missing data from hydroclimate data and accurately identifying these events are still major challenges. The advent of machine learning models can help to identify the occurrence of droughts and floods events accurately and efficiently. Therefore, this proposed study will develop a machine learning model with semi-supervised anomaly detection approach to identify hydrological extreme events with ground-based data. As a test case, we will use 45-years record of hydroclimate data in coastal California, where was the driest region in 2012-2015,
    following with flash floods events. The expected results will increase communities’ awareness for hydrological extreme events and enable environmental planning and resource management under climate change

- paper_title: Predicting Cascading Failures in Power Systems using Graph Convolutional
    Networks
  abstract: 'Worldwide targets are set for the increase of renewable power generation
    in electricity networks on the way to combat climate change. Consequently, a secure
    power system that can handle the complexities resulted from the increased renewable
    power integration is crucial. One particular complexity is the possibility of
    cascading failures — a quick succession of multiple component failures that takes
    down the system and might also lead to a blackout. Viewing the prediction of cascading
    failures as a binary classification task, we explore the efficacy of Graph Convolution
    Networks (GCNs), to detect the early onset of a cascading failure. We perform
    experiments based on simulated data from a benchmark IEEE test system. Our preliminary
    findings show that GCNs achieve higher accuracy scores than other baselines which
    bodes well for detecting cascading failures. It also motivates a more comprehensive
    study of graph-based deep learning techniques for the current problem. '

  abstract: Earthquakes are one of the most catastrophic natural disasters, making
    accurate, fine-grained, and real-time earthquake forecasting extremely important
    for the safety and security of human lives. In this work, we propose DeepQuake,
    a hybrid physics and deep learning model for fine-grained earthquake forecasting
    using time-series data of the horizontal displacement of earth’s surface measured
    from continuously operating Global Positioning System (cGPS) data. Recent studies
    using cGPS data have established a link between transient deformation within earth's
    crust to climate variables. DeepQuake’s physics-based pre-processing algorithm
    extracts relevant features including the x, y, and xy components of strain in
    earth’s crust, capturing earth’s elastic response to these climate variables,
    and feeds it into a deep learning neural network to predict key earthquake variables
    such as the time, location, magnitude, and depth of a future earthquake. Results
    across California show promising correlations between cGPS derived strain patterns
    and the earthquake catalog ground truth for a given location and time.

- paper_title: A day in a sustainable life
  abstract: "In this notebook, we show the reader how to use an electrical battery
    to minimize the operational carbon intensity of a building. The central idea is
    to charge the battery when the carbon intensity of the grid energy mix is low,
    and vice versa. The same methodology is used in practice to optimise for a number
    of different objective functions, including energy costs. \n\nTaking the hypothetical
    case of Pi, an eco-conscious and tech-savvy householder in the UK, we walk the
    reader through getting carbon intensity data, and how to use this with a number
    of different optimisation algorithms to decarbonise. Starting off with easy-to-understand,
    brute force search, we establish a baseline for subsequent (hopefully smarter)
    optimization algorithms. This should come naturally, since in their day job Pi
    is a data scientist where they often use grid and random search to tune hyperparameters
    of ML models. The second optimization algorithm we explore is a genetic algorithm,
    which belongs to the class of derivative free optimizers and is consequently extremely
    versatile. However, the flexibility of these algorithms comes at the cost of computational
    speed and effort. In many situations, it makes sense to utilize an optimization
    method which can make use of the special structure in the problem. As the final
    step, we see how Pi can optimally solve the problem of minimizing their carbon
    intensity by formulating it as a linear program. Along the way, we also keep an
    eye out for some of the most important challenges that arise in practice."

- paper_title: 'Open Catalyst Project: An Introduction to ML applied to Molecular
    Simulations'
  abstract: |
    As the world continues to battle energy scarcity and climate change, the future of our energy infrastructure is a growing challenge. Renewable energy technologies offer the opportunity to drive efficient carbon-neutral means for energy storage and generation. Doing so, however, requires the discovery of efficient and economic catalysts (materials) to accelerate associated chemical processes. A common approach in discovering high performance catalysts is using molecular simulations. Specifically, each simulation models the interaction of a catalyst surface with molecules that are commonly seen in electrochemical reactions. By predicting these interactions accurately, the catalyst's impact on the overall rate of a chemical reaction may be estimated.

    The Open Catalyst Project (OCP) aims to develop new ML methods and models to accelerate the catalyst simulation process for renewable energy technologies and improve our ability to predict properties across catalyst composition. The initial release of the Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset presented the largest open dataset of molecular combinations, spanning 55 unique elements and over 130M+ data points. We will present a comprehensive tutorial of the Open Catalyst Project repository, including (1) Accessing & visualizing the dataset, (2) Overview of the various tasks, (3) Training graph neural network (GNN) models, (4) Developing your own model for OCP, (5) Running ML-driven simulations, and (6) Visualizing the results. Primary tools include PyTorch and PyTorch Geometric. No background in chemistry is assumed. Following this tutorial we hope to better equip attendees with a basic understanding of the data and repository.
