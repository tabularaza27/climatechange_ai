- paper_title: Examining the nexus of environmental policy, climate physics, and maritime
    shipping with deep learning models and space-borne data
  abstract: 'Ship-tracks are produced by ship exhaust interacting with marine low
    clouds. They provide an ideal lab for constraining a critical climate forcing.
    However, no global survey of ship ship-tracks has been made since its discovery
    55 years ago, which limits research  progress. Here we present the first global
    map of ship-tracks produced by applying deep segmentation models to large satellite
    data. Our model generalizes well and is validated against independent data. Large-scale
    ship-track data are at the nexus of environmental policy, climate physics, and
    maritime shipping industry: they can be used to study aerosol-cloud interactions,
    the largest uncertainty source in climate forcing; to evaluate compliance and
    impacts of environmental policies; and to study the impact of significant socioeconomic
    events on maritime shipping. Based on twenty years of global data, we show cloud
    physics responses in ship-tracks strongly depend on the cloud regime. Inter-annual
    fluctuation in ship-track frequency clearly reflects international trade/economic
    trends. Emission policies strongly affect the pattern of shipping routes and ship-track
    occurrence. The combination of stricter fuel standard and the COVID-19 pandemic
    pushed global ship-track frequency to the lowest level in the record. More applications
    of our technique and data are envisioned such as detecting illicit shipping activity
    and checking policy compliance of individual ships.'

- paper_title: A human-labeled Landsat-8 contrails dataset
  abstract: Contrails (condensation trails) are the ice clouds that trail behind aircraft
    as they fly through cold and moist regions of the atmosphere. Avoiding these regions
    could potentially be an inexpensive way to reduce over half of aviation's impact
    on global warming. Development and evaluation of these avoidance strategies greatly
    benefits from the ability to detect contrails on satellite imagery. Since little
    to no public data is available to develop such contrail detectors, we construct
    and release a dataset of several thousand Landsat-8 scenes with pixel-level annotations
    of contrails. The dataset will continue to grow, but currently contains 4289 scenes
    (of which 47% have at least one contrail) representing 950+ person-hours of labeling
    time.

- paper_title: Urban Tree Species Classification Using Aerial Imagery
  abstract: Urban trees help regulate temperature, reduce energy consumption, improve
    urban air quality, reduce wind speeds, and mitigating the urban heat island effect.
    Urban trees also play a key role in climate change mitigation and global warming
    by capturing and storing atmospheric carbon-dioxide which is the largest contributor
    to greenhouse gases. Automated tree detection and species classification using
    aerial imagery can be a powerful tool for sustainable forest and urban tree management.
    Hence, This study first offers a pipeline for generating labelled dataset of urban
    trees using Google Map's aerial images and then investigates how state of the
    art deep Convolutional Neural Network models such as VGG and ResNet handle the
    classification problem of urban tree aerial images under different parameters.
    Experimental results show our best model achieves an average accuracy of 60% over
    6 tree species.

- paper_title: Estimation of Corporate Greenhouse Gas Emissions via Machine Learning
  abstract: As an important step to fulfill the Paris Agreement and achieve net-zero
    emissions by 2050, the European Commission adopted the most ambitious package
    of climate impact measures in April 2021 to improve the flow of capital towards
    sustainable activities. For these and other international measures to be successful,
    reliable data is key. The ability to see the carbon footprint of companies around
    the world will be critical for investors to comply with the measures and hit climate
    neutrality. However, with only a small portion of companies volunteering to disclose
    their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, it is nearly impossible for investors to
    align their investment strategies with the measures. By training a machine learning
    model on disclosed GHG emissions, we are able to estimate the emissions of other
    companies globally who do not disclose their emissions. In this paper, we show
    that our model provides accurate estimates of corporate GHG emissions to investors
    such that they are able to align their investments with the regulatory measures
    and achieve net-zero goals.

    for Scalable Calibration of Physics-Informed Digital Twins'
  abstract: 'Physics-informed dynamical system models form critical components of
    digital twins of the built environment. These digital twins enable the design
    of energy-efficient infrastructure, but must be properly calibrated to accurately
    reflect system behavior for downstream prediction and analysis. Dynamical system
    models of modern buildings are typically described by a large number of parameters
    and incur significant computational expenditure during simulations. To handle
    large-scale calibration of digital twins without exorbitant simulations, we propose
    ANP-BBO: a scalable and parallelizable  batch-wise Bayesian optimization (BBO)
    methodology that leverages attentive neural processes (ANPs).'

- paper_title: Seasonal Sea Ice Presence Forecasting of Hudson Bay using Seq2Seq Learning
  abstract: Accurate and timely forecasts of sea ice conditions are crucial for safe
    shipping operations in the Canadian Arctic and other ice-infested waters. Given
    the advancement of machine-learning methods and the recent observations on the
    declining trend of Arctic sea ice extent over the past decades due to global warming,
    new machine learning approaches are deployed to provide additional sea ice forecasting
    products. This study is novel in comparison with previous machine learning (ML)
    approaches in the sea-ice forecasting domain as it provides a daily spatial map
    of probability of ice presence in the domain up to 90 days. The predictions are
    further used to predict freeze-up/breakup dates and show their capability to capture
    both the variability and the increasing trend of open water season in the domain
    over the past decades.

- paper_title: Semantic Segmentation on Unbalanced Remote Sensing Classes for Active
    Fire
  abstract: Wildfires generate considerable research interest due to their high frequency
    of occurrence along with global climate change. Future wildfire detection sensors
    would equip an on-orbit processing module that filters the useless raw images
    before data transmission. To efficiently detect heat anomalies from the single
    large scene,  we need to handle the unbalanced sample sets between small active
    fire pixels and large-size complex background information. In this study, we contribute
    to solving this problem by enhancing the target feature representation in three
    ways. We first preprocess training images by constraining sampling ranges and
    removing background patches. Then we use the object-contextual representation
    (OCR) module to strengthen the active fire pixel representation based on the self-attention
    unit. The HRNet backbone provides multi-scale pixel representation as input to
    the OCR module. Finally, the combined loss of weighted cross-entropy loss and
    Lovasz hinge loss improve the segmentation accuracy further by optimizing the
    IoU of the foreground class. The performance is tested on the aerial FLAME dataset,
    whose ratio between labeled active fire and background pixels is 5.6%.  The proposed
    framework improves the mIoU from 83.10% (baseline U-Net) to 90.81%. Future research
    will expand the technique for active fire detection using satellite images.

- paper_title: Improving Image-Based Characterization of Porous Media with Deep Generative
    Models
  abstract: Micro- and nanoscale imaging are important for characterizing subsurface
    formations for carbon sequestration, shale gas recovery, and hydrogen storage.
    Common imaging techniques, however, are often sample-destructive, expensive, require
    high levels of expertise, or only acquire planar data. The resulting image datasets
    therefore may not allow for a representative estimation of rock properties. In
    this work, we address these challenges in image-based characterization of porous
    media using deep generative models. We present a machine learning workflow for
    characterizing porous media from limited imaging data. We develop methods for
    3D image volume translation and synthesis from 2D training data, apply this method
    to grayscale and multimodal image datasets of sandstones and shales, and simulate
    flow through the generated volumes. Results show that the proposed image reconstruction
    and generation approaches produce realistic pore-scale 3D representations of rock
    samples using only 2D training data. The models proposed here expand our capabilities
    for characterization of rock samples and enable new understanding of pore-scale
    storage and recovery processes.

- paper_title: Forest Terrain Identification using Semantic Segmentation on UAV Images
  abstract: Beavers' habitat is known to alter the terrain, providing biodiversity
    in the area, and recently their lifestyle is linked to climatic changes by reducing
    greenhouse gases levels in the region. To analyse the impact of beavers’ habitat
    on the region, it is, therefore, necessary to estimate the terrain alterations
    caused by beaver actions. Furthermore, such terrain analysis can also play an
    important role in domains like wildlife ecology, deforestation, land-cover estimations,
    and geological mapping. Deep learning models are known to provide better estimates
    on automatic feature identification and classification of a terrain. However,
    such models require significant training data. Pre-existing terrain datasets (both
    real and synthetic) like CityScapes, PASCAL, UAVID, etc, are mostly concentrated
    on urban areas and include roads, pathways, buildings, etc. Such datasets, therefore,
    are unsuitable for forest terrain analysis. This paper contributes, by providing
    a finely labelled novel dataset of forest imagery around beavers’ habitat, captured
    from a high-resolution camera on an aerial drone. The dataset consists of 100
    such images labelled and classified based on 9 different classes. Furthermore,
    a baseline is established on this dataset using state-of-the-art semantic segmentation
    models based on performance metrics including Intersection Over Union (IoU), Overall
    Accuracy (OA), and F1 score.

- paper_title: Climate-based ensemble machine learning model to forecast Dengue epidemics
  abstract: 'Dengue fever is one of the most common and rapidly spreading arboviral
    diseases in the world, with major public health and economic consequences in tropical
    and sub-tropical regions. Countries such as Peru, 17.143 cases of dengue were
    reported in 2019, where 81.4% of cases concentrated in five of the 25 departments.
    When predicting infectious disease outbreaks, it is crucial to model the long-term
    dependency in time series data. However, this is challenging when performed on
    a countrywide level since dengue incidence varies across administrative areas.
    Therefore, this study developed and applied a climate-based ensemble model using
    multiple machine learning (ML) approaches to forecast dengue incidence rate (DIR)
    by department. The ensemble combined the outputs from Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
    recurrent neural network and Categorical Boosting (CatBoost) methods to predict
    DIR one month ahead for each department in Peru. Monthly dengue cases stratified
    by Peruvian departments were analysed in conjunction with associated demographic,
    geographic, and satellite-based meteorological data for the period January 2010–December
    2019. The results demonstrated that the ensemble model was able to forecast DIR
    in low-transmission departments, while the model was less able to detect sudden
    DIR peaks in some departments. Air temperature and wind components demonstrated
    to be the significant predictors for DIR predictions. This dengue forecast model
    is timely and can help local governments to implement effective control measures
    and mitigate the effects of the disease. This study advances the state-of-the-art
    of climate services for the public health sector, by informing what are the key
    climate factors responsible for triggering dengue transmission. Finally, this
    project summarises how important it is to perform collaborative work with complementary
    expertise from intergovernmental organizations and public health universities
    to advance knowledge and address societal challenges. '

- paper_title: Physics-Informed Graph Neural Networks for Robust Fault Location in
    Power Grids
  abstract: 'The reducing cost of renewable energy resources, such as solar photovoltaics
    (PV) and wind farms, is accelerating global energy transformation to mitigate
    climate change. However, a high level of intermittent renewable energy causes
    power grids to have more stability issues. This accentuates the need for quick
    location of system failures and follow-up control actions. In recent events such
    as in California, line failures have resulted in large-scale wildfires leading
    to loss of life and property. In this article, we propose a two-stage graph learning
    framework to locate power grid faults in the challenging but practical regime
    characterized by (a) sparse observations, (b) low label rates, and (c) system
    variability. Our approach embeds the geometrical structure of power grids into
    the graph neural networks (GNN) in stage I for fast fault location, and then stage
    II further enhances the location accuracy by employing the physical similarity
    of the labeled and unlabeled data samples. We compare our approach with three
    baselines in the IEEE 123-node benchmark system and show that it outperforms the
    others by significant margins in various scenarios. '

- paper_title: Prediction of Boreal Peatland Fires in Canada using Spatio-Temporal
    Methods
  abstract: Peat fires are the largest fires on earth in terms of fuel consumption
    and are responsible for a significant portion of global carbon emissions. Predicting
    fires in the peatlands can help decision-makers and researchers monitor and prevent
    peat fires. Despite this, research on predicting peatland fires remains largely
    understudied as compared to the prediction of other forms of fires. However, peatland
    fires are unique among fires and therefore require datasets and architectures
    attuned to their particular characteristics. In this paper, we present a new dataset,
    PeatSet, designed specifically for the problem of peatland fire prediction. In
    addition, we propose several models to tackle the problem of fire prediction for
    the peatlands. We develop novel neural architectures for peatland fire prediction,
    PeatNet, and PT-Net, with a graph-based and a transformer-based architecture,
    respectively. Our results indicate that these new deep-learning architectures
    outperform a regression baseline from existing peatland research. Among all the
    tested models, PT-Net achieves the highest F1 score of 0.1006 and an overall accuracy
    of 99.84%.

- paper_title: Revealing the impact of global warming on climate modes using transparent
    machine learning and a suite of climate models
  abstract: The ocean is key to climate through its ability to store and transport
    heat and carbon. From studies of past climates, it is clear that the ocean can
    exhibit a range of dramatic variability that could have catastrophic impacts on
    society, such as changes in rainfall, severe weather, sea level rise and large
    scale climate patterns. The mechanisms of change remain obscure, but are explored
    using a transparent machine learning method, Tracking global Heating with Ocean
    Regimes (THOR) presented here. We investigate two future scenarios, one where
    CO2 is increased by 1% per year, and one where CO2 is abruptly quadrupled. THOR
    is engineered combining interpretable and explainable methods to reveal its source
    of predictive skill. At the core of THOR, is the identification of dynamically
    coherent regimes governing the circulation, a fundamental question within oceanography.
    Three key regions are investigated here. First, the North Atlantic circulation
    that delivers heat to the higher latitudes is seen to weaken and we identify associated
    dynamical changes. Second, the Southern Ocean circulation, the strongest circulation
    on earth, is seen to intensify where we reveal the implications for interactions
    with the ice on Antarctica. Third, shifts in ocean circulation regimes are identified
    in the tropical Pacific region, with potential impacts on the El Nino Southern
    Oscillation, Earth’s dominant source of year-to-year climate variations affecting
    weather extremes, ecosystems, agriculture, and fisheries. Together with revealing
    these climatically relevant ocean dynamics, THOR also constitutes a step towards
    trustworthy machine learning called for within oceanography and beyond because
    its predictions are physically tractable. We conclude with by highlighting open
    questions and potentially fruitful avenues of further machine learning applications
    to climate research.

- paper_title: Challenges in Applying Audio Classification Models to Datasets Containing
    Crucial Biodiversity Information
  abstract: The acoustic signature of a natural soundscape can reveal consequences
    of climate change on biodiversity. Hardware costs, human labor time, and expertise
    dedicated to labeling audio are impediments to conducting acoustic surveys across
    a representative portion of an ecosystem. These barriers are quickly eroding away
    with the advent of low-cost, easy to use, open source hardware and the expansion
    of the machine learning field providing pre-trained neural networks to test on
    retrieved acoustic data. One consistent challenge in passive acoustic monitoring
    (PAM) is a lack of reliability from neural networks on audio recordings collected
    in the field that contain crucial biodiversity information that otherwise show
    promising results from publicly available training and test sets. To demonstrate
    this challenge, we tested a hybrid recurrent neural network (RNN) and convolutional
    neural network (CNN) binary classifier trained for bird presence/absence on two
    Peruvian bird audiosets. The RNN achieved an area under the receiver operating
    characteristics (AUROC) of 95% on a dataset collected from Xeno-canto and Google’s
    AudioSet ontology in contrast to 65% across a stratified random sample of field
    recordings collected from the Madre de Dios region of the Peruvian Amazon. In
    an attempt to alleviate this discrepancy, we applied various audio data augmentation
    techniques in the network’s training process which led to an AUROC of 77% across
    the field recordings.

- paper_title: Learning Optimal Power Flow with Infeasibility Awareness
  abstract: Optimal power flow provides an energy-efficient operating point for power
    grids and therefore supports climate change mitigation. This function has to be
    run every few minutes day and night, thus a reliable and computationally efficient
    solution method is of vital importance. Deep learning seems a promising direction,
    and related works have emerged recently. However, considering feasible scenarios
    only during the learning process, existing works will mislead system operators
    in infeasible scenarios and pose a new threat to system resilience. Paying attention
    to infeasibility in the decision making process, this paper tackles this emerging
    threat with multi-task learning. Case studies on the IEEE test system validate
    the effectiveness of the proposed method.

- paper_title: Reconstructing Aerosol Vertical Profiles with Aggregate Output Learning
  abstract: Aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the largest source of uncertainty
    in assessments of the anthropogenic climate change. This uncertainty arises in
    part from the inability to observe aerosol amounts at the cloud formation levels,
    and, more broadly, the vertical distribution of aerosols. Hence, we often have
    to settle for less informative two-dimensional proxies, i.e. vertically aggregated
    data. In this work, we formulate the problem of disaggregation of vertical profiles
    of aerosols. We propose some initial solutions for such aggregate output regression
    problem and demonstrate their potential on climate model data.

    in Neural Networks for Earth System Models'
  abstract: Ensemble data from Earth system models has to be calibrated and post-processed.
    I propose a novel member-by-member post-processing approach with neural networks.
    I bridge ideas from ensemble data assimilation with self-attention, resulting
    into the self-attentive ensemble transformer. Here, interactions between ensemble
    members are represented as additive and dynamic self-attentive part. As proof-of-concept,
    I regress global ECMWF ensemble forecasts to 2-metre-temperature fields from the
    ERA5 reanalysis. I demonstrate that the ensemble transformer can calibrate the
    ensemble spread and extract additional information from the ensemble. As it is
    a member-by-member approach, the ensemble transformer directly outputs multivariate
    and spatially-coherent ensemble members. Therefore, self-attention and the transformer
    technique can be a missing piece for a non-parametric post-processing of ensemble
    data with neural networks.

    Problems without Ground Truth'
  abstract: AC optimal power flow (AC-OPF) problems need to be solved more frequently
    in the future to maintain the reliable and cost-effective operation of power systems.
    Recently, supervised-learning approaches have been developed to speed up the solving
    time of AC-OPF problems without incurring infeasibility or much optimality loss
    by learning the load-solution mapping embedded in the training dataset. However,
    it is non-trivial and computationally expensive to prepare the training dataset
    with single embedded mapping, due to that AC-OPF problems are non-convex and may
    admit multiple optimal solutions. In this paper, we develop an unsupervised learning
    approach (DeepOPF-NGT) for solving AC-OPF problems, which does not require training
    datasets with ground truth to operate. Instead, it uses a properly designed loss
    function to guide the tuning of the neural network parameters to directly learn
    one load-solution mapping. Preliminary results on the IEEE 30-bus test system
    show that the unsupervised DeepOPF-NGT approach can achieve comparable optimality,
    feasibility, and speedup performance against an existing supervised learning approach.

- paper_title: Commercial Vehicle Traffic Detection from Satellite Imagery with Deep
    Learning
  abstract: 'Road freight traffic is a major greenhouse gas emitter: commercial vehicles
    (CVs) contribute ∼7% to the global CO 2 emission budget, a fraction that is likely
    to  increase in the future. The quantitative monitoring of CV traffic rates, while
    essential for the implementation of targeted road emission regulations, is costly
    and as such only available in developed regions. In this work, we investigate
    the feasibility of estimating hourly CV traffic rates from freely available Sentinel-2
    satellite imagery. We train a modified Faster R-CNN object detection model to
    detect individual CVs in satellite images and feed the resulting counts into a
    regression model to predict hourly CV traffic rates. This architecture, when trained
    on ground-truth data for Switzerland, is able to estimate hourly CV traffic rates
    for any freeway section within 58% (MAPE) of the actual value; for freeway sections
    with historic information on CV traffic rates, we can predict hourly CV traffic
    rates up to within 4% (MAPE). We successfully apply our model to freeway sections
    in other coun tries and show-case its utility by quantifying the change in traffic
    patterns as a result of the first CoVID-19 lockdown in Switzerland. Our results
    show that it is possible to estimate hourly CV traffic rates from satellite images,
    which can guide civil engineers and policy makers, especially in developing countries,
    in monitoring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from CV traffic.'

- paper_title: Probabilistic Short-Term Low-Voltage Load Forecasting using Bernstein-Polynomial
    Normalizing Flows
  abstract: "The transition to a fully renewable energy grid requires better forecasting
    of demand at the low-voltage level. However, high fluctuations and increasing
    electrification cause huge forecast errors with traditional point estimates.\nProbabilistic
    load forecasts take future uncertainties into account and thus enables various
    applications in low-carbon energy systems.\nWe propose an approach for flexible
    conditional density forecasting of short-term load based on Bernstein-Polynomial
    Normalizing Flows where a neural network controls the parameters of the flow.
    In an empirical study with 363 smart meter customers, our density predictions
    compare favorably against Gaussian and Gaussian mixture densities and also outperform
    a non-parametric approach based on the pinball loss for 24h-ahead load forecasting
    for two different neural network architectures.  \n"

    self-play reinforcement learning (RL) and traditional planning to solve the unit
    commitment problem, an essential power systems scheduling task. Applied to problems
    with stochastic demand and wind generation, our results show significant cost
    reductions and improvements to security of supply as compared with an industry-standard

    achieves carbon emissions reductions of up to 10\%. Our results demonstrate scalability

- paper_title: 'DroughtED: A dataset and methodology for drought forecasting spanning
    multiple climate zones'
  abstract: 'Climate change exacerbates the frequency, duration and extent of extreme
    weather events such as drought. Previous attempts to forecast drought conditions
    using machine learning have focused on regional models which have two major limitations
    for national drought management: (i) they are trained on localised climate data
    and (ii) their architectures prevent them from being applied to new heterogeneous
    regions. In this work, we present a new large-scale dataset for training machine
    learning models to forecast national drought conditions, named DroughtED. The
    dataset consists of globally available meteorological features widely used for
    drought prediction, paired with location meta-data which has not previously been
    utilised for drought forecasting. Here we also establish a baseline on DroughtED
    and present the first research to apply deep learning models - Long Short-Term
    Memory (LSTMs) and Transformers - to predict county-level drought conditions across
    the full extent of the United States. Our results indicate that DroughtED enables
    deep learning models to learn cross-region patterns in climate data that contribute
    to drought conditions and models trained on DroughtED compare favourably to state-of-the-art
    drought prediction models trained on individual regions.'

- paper_title: 'Estimation of Air Pollution with Remote Sensing Data: Revealing Greenhouse
    Gas Emissions from Space'
  abstract: |-
    Air pollution is a major driver of climate change. Anthropogenic emissions from the burning of fossil fuels for transportation and power generation emit large amounts of problematic air pollutants, including Greenhouse Gases (GHGs).
    Despite the importance of limiting GHG emissions to mitigate climate change, detailed information about the spatial and temporal distribution of GHG and other air pollutants is difficult to obtain. Existing models for surface-level air pollution rely on extensive land-use datasets which are often locally restricted and temporally static. This work proposes a deep learning approach for the prediction of ambient air pollution that only relies on remote sensing data that is globally available and frequently updated. Combining optical satellite imagery with satellite-based atmospheric column density air pollution measurements enables the scaling of air pollution estimates (in this case NO2) to high spatial resolution (up to ~10m) at arbitrary locations and adds a temporal component to these estimates. The proposed model performs with high accuracy when evaluated against air quality measurements from ground stations (mean absolute error <6 microgram/m^3). Our results enable the identification and temporal monitoring of major sources of air pollution and GHGs.

- paper_title: Emulating Aerosol Microphysics with a Machine Learning
  abstract: Aerosol particles play an important role in the climate system by absorbing
    and scattering radiation and influencing cloud properties. They are also one of
    the biggest sources of uncertainty for climate modeling. Many climate models do
    not include aerosols in sufficient detail. In order to achieve higher accuracy,
    aerosol microphysical properties and processes have to be accounted for. This
    is done in the ECHAM-HAM global climate aerosol model using the M7 microphysics
    model, but increased computational costs make it very expensive to run at higher
    resolutions or for a longer time. We aim to use machine learning to approximate
    the microphysics model at sufficient accuracy and reduce the computational cost
    by being fast at inference time. The original M7 model is used to generate data
    of input-output pairs to train a neural network on it. By using a special logarithmic
    transform we are able to learn the variables tendencies achieving an average $R^2$
    score of $89\%$. On a GPU we achieve a speed-up of 120 compared to the original
    model.

- paper_title: Automated Identification of Climate Risk Disclosures in Annual Corporate
    Reports
  abstract: It is important for policymakers to understand which financial policies
    are effective in increasing climate risk disclosure in corporate reporting. We
    use machine learning to automatically identify disclosures of five different types
    of climate-related risks. For this purpose, we have created a dataset of over
    120 manually-annotated annual reports by European firms. Applying our approach
    to reporting of 337 firms over the last 20 years, we find that risk disclosure
    is increasing. Disclosure of transition risks grows more dynamically than physical
    risks, and there are marked differences across industries. Country-specific dynamics
    indicate that regulatory environments potentially have an important role to play
    for increasing disclosure.

- paper_title: Forecasting Black Sigatoka Infection Risks with Latent Neural ODEs
  abstract: Black Sigatoka is the most widely-distributed and destructive disease
    affecting banana plants. Due to the heavy financial burden of managing this infectious
    disease, farmers in developing countries face significant banana crop losses.
    The spread of black Sigatoka is highly dependent on weather conditions and though
    scientists have produced mathematical models of infectious diseases, adapting
    these models to incorporate climate effects is difficult. We present MR. NODE
    (Multiple predictoR Neural ODE), a neural network that models the dynamics of
    black Sigatoka infection learnt directly from data via Neural Ordinary Differential
    Equations. Our method encodes external predictor factors into the latent space
    in addition to the variable that we infer, and it can also predict the infection
    risk at an arbitrary point in time. Empirically, we demonstrate on historical
    climate data that our method has superior generalization performance on time points
    up to one month in the future and unseen irregularities. We believe that our method
    can be a useful tool to control the spread of black Sigatoka.

  abstract: Efficient sector coupling in residential buildings plays a key role in
    supporting the energy transition. In this study, we analyze the potential of using
    reinforcement learning (RL) to control a home energy management system. We conduct
    this study by modeling a representative building with a modulating air-sourced
    heat pump, a photovoltaic system, a battery, and thermal storage systems for floor
    heating and hot-water supply. In our numerical analysis, we benchmark our reinforcement
    learning results using DDPG with the optimal solution generated with model predictive
    control using a mixed-integer linear model under full information. Our input data,
    models, and the RL environment, developed using the Julia programming language,
    will be available in an open-source manner.

- paper_title: 'Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Frequency Control: A Lyapunov Approach'
  abstract: |-
    Renewable energy resources play a vital role in reducing carbon emissions and are becoming increasingly common in the grid. On one hand, they are challenging to integrate into a power system because the lack of rotating mechanical inertia can lead to frequency instabilities. On the other hand, these resources have power electronic interfaces that are capable of implementing almost arbitrary control laws. To design these controllers, reinforcement learning has emerged as a popular method to search for policy parameterized by neural networks.


    The key challenge with learning based approaches is enforcing the constraint that the learned controller need to be stabilizing. Through a Lyapunov function, we explicitly identify the structure of neural network-based controllers such that they guarantee system stability by design.  A recurrent RL architecture is used to efficiently train the controllers and they outperform other approaches as demonstrated by simulations.

  abstract: |-
    Birds are shifting migratory routes and timing in
    response to climate change, but modeling migration to better understand these changes is difficult.
    Some recent work leverages fluid dynamics models, but this requires individual flight speed and
    directional data which may not be readily available. We developed an alternate modeling method
    which only requires population level positional
    data and use it to model migration routes of the
    American Woodcock (Scolopax minor). We use
    our model to sample simulated bird trajectories
    and compare them to real trajectories in order to
    evaluate the model.

  abstract: This paper proposes a cascading failure mitigation strategy based on Reinforcement
    Learning (RL) method. Firstly, the principles of RL are introduced. Then, the
    Multi-Stage Cascading Failure (MSCF) problem is formulated, and its challenges
    are investigated. The problem is then tackled by the RL based on DCOPF (Direct
    Current Optimal Power Flow). Designs of the RL framework (rewards, states, etc.)
    are illustrated in detail. Experiments on the IEEE 118-bus system by the proposed
    RL method demonstrate promising performance in reducing system collapses.

- paper_title: 'Decadal Forecasts with ResDMD: a residual DMD neural network'
  abstract: Significant investment is being made by operational forecasting centers
    to produce decadal (1-10 year) forecasts that can support long-term decision making
    for a more climate-resilient society. One method that has been employed for this
    task is the Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) algorithm – also known as the Linear
    Inverse Model– which is used to fit linear dynamical models to data.  While the
    DMD usually approximates non-linear terms in the true dynamics as a linear system
    with random noise, we investigate an extension to the DMD to explicitly represent
    the non-linear terms as a neural network. Our weight initialization allows the
    network to produce sensible results before training and then improve the prediction
    after training as data becomes available. In this short paper, we evaluate the
    proposed architecture for simulating global sea surface temperatures and compare
    the results with the standard DMD and seasonal forecasts produced by the state-of-the-art
    dynamical model, CFSv2.

    Twitter Data'
  abstract: Acquiring a better understanding of drought impacts becomes increasingly
    vital under a warming climate. Traditional drought indices describe mainly biophysical
    variables and not impacts on social, economic, and environmental systems. We utilized
    natural language processing and bidirectional encoder representation from Transformers
    (BERT) based transfer learning to fine-tune the model on the data from the news-based
    Drought Impact Report (DIR) and then apply it to recognize seven types of drought
    impacts based on the filtered Twitter data from the United States. Our model achieved
    a satisfying macro-F1 score of 0.89 on the DIR test set. The model was then applied
    to California tweets and validated with keyword-based labels. The macro-F1 score
    was 0.58. However, due to the limitation of keywords, we also spot-checked tweets
    with controversial labels. 83.5% of BERT labels were correct compared to the keyword
    labels. Overall, the fine-tuned BERT-based recognizer provided proper predictions
    and valuable information on drought impacts. The interpretation and analysis of
    the model were consistent with experiential domain expertise.

    Market
  abstract: Solving the optimal power flow (OPF) problem in real-time electricity
    market improves the efficiency and reliability in the integration of low-carbon
    energy resources into the power grids. To address the scalability and adaptivity
    issues of existing end-to-end OPF learning solutions, we propose a new graph neural
    network (GNN) framework for predicting the electricity market prices from solving
    OPFs. The proposed GNN-for-OPF framework innovatively exploits the locality property
    of prices and introduces physics-aware regularization, while attaining reduced
    model complexity and fast adaptivity to varying grid topology. Numerical tests
    have validated the learning efficiency and adaptivity improvements of our proposed
    method over existing approaches.

- paper_title: Learning Granger Causal Feature Representations
  abstract: "Tackling climate change needs to understand the complex phenomena occurring
    on the Planet. Discovering  teleconnection patterns is an essential part of the
    endeavor. Events like El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) impact essential climate
    variables at large distances, and influence the underlying Earth system dynamics.
    \nHowever, their automatic identification from the wealth of observational data
    is still unresolved. Nonlinearities, nonstationarities and the (ab)use of correlation
    analyses hamper the discovery of true causal patterns.  \nWe here introduce a
    deep learning methodology that extracts nonlinear latent functions from spatio-temporal
    Earth data and that are Granger causal with the index altogether. We illustrate
    its use to study the impact of ENSO on vegetation, which allows for a more rigorous
    study of impacts on ecosystems globally."

- paper_title: 'DeepPolicyTracker: Tracking Changes In Environmental Policy In The
    Brazilian Federal Official Gazette With Deep Learning'
  abstract: Even though most of its energy generation comes from renewable sources,
    Brazil is one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases in the world, due to
    intense farming and deforestation of biomes, such as the Amazon Rainforest, whose
    preservation is essential for compliance with the Paris Agreement. Still, regardless
    of lobbies or prevailing political orientation, all government legal actions are
    published daily in the Federal Official Gazette. However, with hundreds of decrees
    issued every day by the authorities, it is absolutely burdensome to manually analyze
    all these processes and find out which ones can pose serious environmental hazards.
    In this paper, we propose the DeepPolicyTracker, a promising deep learning model
    that uses a state-of-the-art pre-trained natural language model to classify government
    acts and track harmful changes in the environmental policies. We also provide
    the used dataset annotated by domain experts and show some results already obtained.
    In the future, this system should serve to scale up the high-quality tracking
    of all oficial documents with a minimum of human supervision and contribute to
    increasing society's awareness of every government action.

  abstract: Streamflow forecasting is key to effectively managing water resources
    and preparing for the occurrence of natural calamities being exacerbated by climate
    change. Here we use the concept of fast and slow flow components to create a new
    mass-conserving Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model. It uses hydrometeorological
    time series and catchment attributes to predict daily river discharges. Preliminary
    results evidence improvement in skills for different scores compared to the recent
    literature.

- paper_title: Attention For Damage Assessment
  abstract: Due to climate change the hurricanes are getting stronger and having longer
    impacts. To reduce the detrimental effects of these hurricanes faster and accurate
    assessments of damages are essential to the rescue teams. Like other computer
    vision techniques semantic segmentation can identify the damages and help in proper
    and prompt damage assessment. Current segmentation methods can be classified into
    attention and non-attention based methods. Existing non-attention based methods
    suffers from low accuracy and therefore attention based methods are becoming popular.
    Self-attention based methods can map the mutual relationship and dependencies
    among pixels of an image and thus improve semantic segmentation accuracy. In this
    paper, we present a self-attention semantic segmentation method on UAV imageries
    to assess the damages inflicted by a natural disaster. The proposed method outperforms
    four state-of-art segmentation methods both quantitatively and qualitatively with
    a mean IoU score of 84.03 %.

- paper_title: Online LSTM Framework for Hurricane Trajectory Prediction
  abstract: Hurricanes are high-intensity tropical cyclones that can cause severe
    damages when the storms make landfall. Accurate long-range prediction of hurricane
    trajectories is an important but challenging problem due to the complex interactions
    between the ocean and atmosphere systems. In this paper, we present a deep learning
    framework for hurricane trajectory forecasting by leveraging the outputs from
    an ensemble of dynamical (physical) models. The proposed framework employs a temporal
    decay memory unit for imputing missing values in the ensemble member outputs,
    coupled with an LSTM architecture for dynamic path prediction. The framework is
    extended to an online learning setting to capture concept drift present in the
    data. Empirical results suggest that the proposed framework significantly outperforms
    various baselines including the official forecasts from U.S. National Hurricane
    Center (NHC).

- paper_title: Controlling Weather Field Synthesis Using Variational Autoencoders
  abstract: One of the consequences of climate change is an observed increase in the
    frequency of extreme climate events. That poses a challenge for weather forecast
    and generation algorithms, which learn from historical data but should embed an
    often uncertain bias to create correct scenarios. This paper investigates how
    mapping climate data to a known distribution using variational autoencoders might
    help explore such biases and control the synthesis of weather fields towards more
    extreme climate scenarios. We experimented using a monsoon-affected precipitation
    dataset from southwest India, which should give a roughly stable pattern of rainy
    days and ease our investigation. We report compelling results showing that mapping
    complex weather data to a known distribution implements an efficient control for
    weather field synthesis towards more (or less) extreme scenarios.

    Image Classification in Deforestation Analysis'
  abstract: Understanding the dynamics of deforestation as well as land uses of neighboring
    areas is of vital importance for the design and development of appropriate forest
    conservation and management policies. In this paper, we approach deforestation
    as a multi-label classification problem in an endeavor to capture the various
    relevant land uses from satellite images. To this end, we propose a multi-label
    vision transformer model, ForestViT, which leverages the benefits of self-attention
    mechanism, obviating any convolution operations involved in commonly used deep
    learning models utilized for deforestation detection.

- paper_title: Reducing Carbon in the Design of Large Infrastructure Scheme with Evolutionary
    Algorithms
  abstract: 'The construction and operations of large infrastructure schemes such
    as railways, roads, pipelines and power lines account for a significant proportion
    of global carbon emissions. Opportunities to reduce the embodied and operational
    carbon emissions of new infrastructure schemes are greatest during the design
    phase. However, schedule and cost constraints limit designers from assessing a
    large number of design options in detail to identify the solution with the lowest
    lifetime carbon emissions using conventional methods. Here, we develop an evolutionary
    algorithm to rapidly evaluate in detail the lifetime carbon emissions of thousands
    of possible design options for new water transmission pipeline schemes. Our results
    show that this approach can help designers in some cases to identify design solutions
    with more than 10% lower operational carbon emissions compared with conventional
    methods, saving more than 1 million tonnes in lifetime carbon emissions for a
    new water transmission pipeline scheme. We also find that this evolutionary algorithm
    can be applied to design other types of infrastructure schemes such as non-water
    pipelines, railways, roads and power lines. '

- paper_title: An Accurate and Scalable Subseasonal Forecasting Toolkit for the United
    States
  abstract: We develop a subseasonal forecasting toolkit of accurate and highly scalable
    benchmarks that outperform both the United States operational Climate Forecasting
    System (CFSv2) and state-of-the-art learning methods from the literature. Our
    new learned benchmarks include (a) Climatology++, an enhanced form of climatology
    using knowledge of only the day of the year; (b) CFSv2++, a learned correction
    for CFSv2; and (c) Persistence++, an augmented persistence model that combines
    lagged measurements with CFSv2forecasts. These methods alone improve upon CFSv2
    accuracy by 9% for US precipitation and 6% for US temperature over 2011-2020.
    Ensembling our benchmarks with diverse forecasting methods leads to even further
    gains. Overall, we find that augmenting classical forecasting approaches with
    learned corrections yields an effective, low-cost strategy for building next-generation
    subseasonal forecasting models.

- paper_title: Self-supervised Contrastive Learning for Irrigation Detectionin Satellite
    Imagery
  abstract: Climate  change  has  caused  reductions  in  river runoffs and aquifer
    recharge resulting in an increasingly unsustainable crop water demand from reduced
    freshwater availability. Achieving food security while deploying water in a sustainable
    manner will continue to be a major challenge necessitating careful monitoring
    and tracking of agricultural water usage. Historically, monitoring water usage
    has been a slow and expensive manual process with many imperfections and abuses.
    Ma-chine learning and remote sensing developments have increased the ability to
    automatically monitor irrigation patterns,  but existing techniques often require
    curated and labelled irrigation data, which are expensive and time consuming to
    obtain and may not exist for impactful areas such as developing countries.  In
    this paper, we explore an end-to-end real world application of irrigation detection
    with uncurated and unlabeled satellite imagery. We apply state-of-the-art self-supervised
    deep learning techniques to optical remote sensing data, and find that we are
    able to detect irrigation with up to nine times better precision, 90% better recall
    and 40% more generalization ability than the traditional supervised learning methods.

- paper_title: Extreme Precipitation Seasonal Forecast Using a Transformer Neural
    Network
  abstract: 'An impact of climate change is the increase in frequency and intensity
    of extreme precipitation events. However, confidently predicting the likelihood
    of extreme precipitation at seasonal scales remains an outstanding challenge.
    Here, we present an approach to forecasting the quantiles of the maximum daily
    precipitation in each week up to six months ahead using the temporal fusion transformer
    (TFT) model. Through experiments in two regions, we compare TFT predictions with
    those of two baselines: climatology and a calibrated ECMWF SEAS5 ensemble forecast
    (S5). Our results show that, in terms of quantile risk at six month lead time,
    the TFT predictions significantly outperform those from S5 and show an overall
    small improvement compared to climatology. The TFT also responds positively to
    departures from normal that climatology cannot.'

- paper_title: BERT Classification of Paris Agreement Climate Action Plans
  abstract: As the volume of text-based information on climate policy increases, natural
    language processing (NLP) tools can distill information from text to better inform
    decision making on climate policy. We investigate how large pretrained transformers
    based on the BERT architecture classify sentences on a dataset of climate action
    plans which countries submitted to the United Nations following the 2015 Paris
    Agreement. We use the document header structure to assign noisy policy-relevant
    labels such as mitigation, adaptation, energy, and land use to text elements.
    Our models provide an improvement in out-of-sample classification over simple
    heuristics though fall short of the consistency observed between human annotators.
    We hope to extend this framework to a wider class of textual climate change data
    such as climate legislation and corporate social responsibility filings and build
    tools to streamline the extraction of information from these documents for climate
    change researchers.

- paper_title: Quantification of Carbon Sequestration in Urban Forests
  abstract: Vegetation, trees in particular, sequester carbon by absorbing carbon
    dioxide from the atmosphere, however, the lack of efficient quantification methods
    of carbon stored in trees renders it difficult to track the process. Here we present
    an approach to estimate the carbon storage in trees based on fusing multispectral
    aerial imagery and LiDAR data to identify tree coverage, geometric shape, and
    tree species, which are crucial attributes in carbon storage quantification. We
    demonstrate that tree species information and their three-dimensional geometric
    shapes can be estimated from remote imagery in order to calculate the tree's biomass.
    Specifically, for Manhattan, New York City, we estimate a total of 52,000 tons
    of carbon sequestered in trees.

    precipitation synthesis
  abstract: "Future climate change scenarios are usually hypothesized using simulations
    from weather generators. However, there only a few works comparing and evaluating
    multisite weather generators, and there is no existing work contrasting promising
    deep learning approaches for weather generation against classical stochastic weather
    generators. \nThis study shows preliminary results evaluating stochastic weather
    generators and deep generative models for multisite precipitation synthesis. Using
    a variety of metrics, we compare two open source weather generators: XWeathergen
    (an extension of the Weathergen library) and RGeneratePrec, and two deep generative
    models: GAN and VAE.\nOur preliminary results can serve as a guide for improving
    the design of deep learning architectures and algorithms for the multisite precipitation
    synthesis task."

- paper_title: Self-Supervised Learning on Multispectral Satellite Data for Near-Term
    Solar Forecasting
  abstract: "With the unprecedented increase in distributed photovoltaic (PV) capacity
    across the globe, there is an increasing need for reliable and accurate forecasting
    of solar power generation.  While PV output is affected by many factors, the atmosphere,
    i.e., cloud cover, plays a dominant role in determining the amount of downwelling
    solar irradiance that reaches PV modules.  This paper demonstrates that self-supervised
    learning of multispectral satellite data from the recently launched GOES-R series
    of satellites can improve near-term (15 minutes) solar forecasting. \n\nWe develop
    deep auto-regressive models using convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long
    short-term memory networks (LSTM) that are globally trained across many solar
    sites on the raw spatio-temporal data from GOES-R satellites.  This self-supervised
    model provides estimates of future solar irradiance that can be fed directly to
    a regression model trained on smaller site-specific solar data to provide near-term
    solar PV forecasts at the site. The regression implicitly models site-specific
    characteristics, such as capacity, panel tilt, orientation, etc, while the self-supervised
    CNN-LSTM implicitly captures global atmospheric patterns affecting a site's solar
    irradiation. Results across 25 solar sites show the utility of such self-supervised
    modeling by providing accurate near-term forecast with errors close to that of
    a model using current ground-truth observations."

  abstract: Rise in global temperatures is resulting in polar ice caps to melt away,
    which can lead to drastic sea level rise and coastal floods.  Accurate calculation
    of the ice cap reduction is necessary in order to project its climatic impact.  Ice
    sheets are monitored through Snow Radar sensors which give noisy profiles of subsurface
    ice layers. The sensors take snapshots of the entire ice sheet regularly, and
    thus result in large datasets. In this work, we use convolutional neural networks
    (CNNs) for their property of feature extraction and generalizability on large
    datasets.  We also use wavelet transforms and embed them as a layer in the architecture
    to help in denoising the radar images and refine ice layer detection.  Our results
    show that incorporating wavelets in CNNs helps in detecting the position of deep
    subsurface ice layers, which can be used to analyse their change overtime.

- paper_title: Forecasting Sea Ice Concentrations using Attention-based Ensemble LSTM
  abstract: Accurately forecasting Arctic sea ice from sub-seasonal to seasonal scales
    has been a major scientific effort with fundamental challenges at play. In addition
    to physics-based earth system models, researchers have been applying multiple
    statistical and machine learning models for sea ice forecasting. Looking at the
    potential of data-driven sea ice forecasting, we propose an attention-based Long
    Short Term Memory (LSTM) ensemble method to predict monthly sea ice extent up
    to 1 month ahead. Using daily and monthly satellite retrieved sea ice data from
    NSIDC and atmospheric and oceanic variables from ERA5 reanalysis product for 39
    years, we show that our multi-temporal ensemble method outperforms several baseline
    and recently proposed deep learning models. This will substantially improve our
    ability in predicting future Arctic sea ice changes, which is fundamental for
    forecasting transporting routes, resource development, coastal erosion, threats
    to Arctic coastal communities and wildlife.

- paper_title: Toward efficient calibration of higher-resolution Earth System Models
  abstract: 'Projections of future climate change to support decision-making require
    high spatial resolution, but this is computationally prohibitive with modern Earth
    system models (ESMs). A major challenge is the calibration (parameter tuning)
    process, which requires running large numbers of simulations to identify the optimal
    parameter values. Here we train a convolutional neural network (CNN) on simulations
    from two lower-resolution (and thus much less expensive) versions of the same
    ESM, and a smaller number of higher-resolution simulations. Cross-validated results
    show that the CNN''s skill exceeds that of a climatological baseline for most
    variables with as few as 5-10 examples of the higher-resolution ESM, and for all
    variables (including precipitation) with at least 20 examples. This proof-of-concept
    study offers the prospect of significantly more efficient calibration of ESMs,
    by reducing the required CPU time for calibration by 20-40 %. '

- paper_title: 'Visual Question Answering: A Deep Interactive Framework for Post-Disaster
    Management and Damage Assessment'
  abstract: Each natural disaster has left a trail of destruction and damage, which
    must be managed very effectively to reduce the disaster's impact. Lack of proper
    decision making in post-disaster managerial level can increase human suffering
    and waste a great amount of money. Our objective is to incorporate a deep interactive
    approach in the decision-making system especially in a rescue mission after any
    natural disaster for the systematic distribution of the limited resources and
    accelerating the recovery process. We believe that Visual Question Answering (VQA)
    is the finest way to address this issue. In visual question answering, a query-based
    answer regarding the situation of the affected area can add value to the decision-making
    system.  Our main purpose of this study is to develop a Visual Question Answering
    model for post-disaster damage assessment purposes. With this aim, we collect
    the images by UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) after Hurricane Harvey and develop
    a dataset that includes the questions that are very important in the decision
    support system after a natural disaster. In addition, We propose a supervised
    attention-based approach in the modeling segment. We compare our approach with
    the two other baseline attention-based VQA algorithms namely Multimodal Factorized
    Bilinear (MFB) and Stacked Attention Network (SAN). Our approach outperforms in
    providing answers for several types of queries including simple counting, complex
    counting compares to the baseline models.

- paper_title: Designing Bounded min-knapsack Bandits algorithm for Sustainable Demand
    Response
  abstract: "Around 40% of global energy produced is consumed by buildings. By using
    renewable energy resources we can alleviate the dependence on electrical grids.
    Recent trends focus on incentivizing consumers to reduce their demand consumption
    during peak hours for sustainable demand response. To minimize the loss, the distributor
    companies should target the right set of consumers and demand the right amount
    of electricity reductions. This paper proposes a novel bounded integer min-knapsack
    algorithm and shows that the algorithm, while allowing for multiple unit reduction,
    also optimizes the loss to the distributor company within a factor of two (multiplicative)
    and a problem-dependent additive constant. \nExisting CMAB algorithms fail to
    work in this setting due to non-monotonicity of reward function and time-varying
    optimal sets. We propose a novel algorithm Twin-MinKPDR-CB to learn these compliance
    probabilities efficiently. Twin-MinKPDR-CB works for non-monotone reward functions
    bounded min-knapsack constraints and time-varying optimal sets. We find that Twin-MinKPDR-CB
    achieves sub-linear regret of O(log T) with T being the number of rounds demand
    response is run.\n"

    Forecasting
  abstract: Large-scale integration of solar photovoltaics (PV) is challenged by high
    variability in its power output, mainly due to local and short-term cloud events.
    To achieve accurate solar forecasting, it is paramount to accurately predict the
    movement of clouds. Here, we use generative adversarial networks (GANs) to predict
    future sky images based on past sky image sequences and show that our trained
    model can generate realistic future sky images and capture the dynamics of clouds
    in the context frames. The generated images are then evaluated for a downstream
    solar forecasting task; results show promising performance.

    Loads and Hidden Representations'
  abstract: The nexus between transportation, the power grid, and consumer behavior
    is much more pronounced than ever before as the race to decarbonize intensifies.
    Electrification in the transportation sector has led to technology shifts and
    rapid deployment of electric vehicles (EVs). The potential increase in stochastic
    and spatially heterogeneous charging load presents a unique challenge that is
    not well studied, and will have significant impacts on grid operations, emissions,
    and system reliability if not managed effectively. Realistic scenario generators
    can help operators prepare, and machine learning can be leveraged to this end.
    In this work, we develop generative adversarial networks (GANs) to learn distributions
    of electric vehicle (EV) charging sessions and disentangled representations. We
    show that this model successfully parameterizes unlabeled temporal and power patterns
    and is able to generate synthetic data conditioned on these patterns. We benchmark
    the generation capability of this model with Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), and
    empirically show that our proposed model framework is better at capturing charging
    distributions and temporal dynamics.

- paper_title: Reconstruction of Long-Term Historical Electricity Demand Data
  abstract: Long-term planning of a  robust power system requires the understanding
    of changing demand patterns.  Electricity demand is highly weather sensitive.  Thus,
    the supply side variation from introducing intermittent renewable sources, juxtaposed
    with variable demand, will introduce additional challenges in the grid planning
    process. By understanding the spatial and temporal variability of temperature
    over the  US,  the response of demand to natural variability and climate change-related
    effects on temperature can be separated, especially because the effects due to
    the former factor are not known. Through this project, we aim to better support
    the technology& policy development process for power systems by developing machine
    and deep learning ’back-forecasting’ models to reconstruct multidecadaldemand
    records and study the natural variabilityof temperature and its influence on demand.

  abstract: Reducing the carbon footprint of the energy sector will be a vital part
    of the fight against climate change, and doing so will require the widespread
    adoption of renewable energy resources. Optimally integrating a large number of
    these resources requires new control techniques that can both compensate for the
    variability of renewables and satisfy hard engineering constraints. Reinforcement
    learning (RL) is a promising approach to data-driven control, but it is difficult
    to verify that the policies derived from data will be safe. In this paper, we
    combine RL with set-theoretic control to propose a computationally efficient approach
    to safe RL. We demonstrate the method on a simplified power system model and compare
    it with other RL techniques.

- paper_title: A study of battery SoC scheduling using machine learning with renewable
    sources
  abstract: An open energy system (OES) enables the shared distribution of energy
    resources within a community autonomously and efficiently. For this distributed
    system a rooftop solar panel and a battery are installed in each house of the
    community. The OES system monitors the State of Charge (SoC) of each battery independently,
    arbitrates energy-exchange requests from each house, and physically controls peer-to-peer
    energy exchanges. In this study, our goal is to optimize those energy exchanges
    to maximize the renewable energy penetration within the community using machine
    learning techniques. Future household electricity consumption is predicted using
    machine learning from the past time series. The predicted consumption is used
    to determine the next energy-exchange strategy, i.e. when and how much energy
    should be exchanged to minimize the surplus of solar energy. The simulation results
    show that the proposed method can increase the amount of renewable energy penetration
    within the community.

  abstract: Statistical downscaling is a vital tool in generating high resolution
    projections for climate impact studies. This study applies convolutional latent
    neural processes to multivariate downscaling of maximum temperature and precipitation.
    In contrast to existing downscaling methods, this model is shown to produce spatially
    coherent predictions at arbitrary locations specified at test time, regardless
    of whether training data are available at these points.

  abstract: Effective environmental planning and management to address climate change
    could be achieved through extensive environmental modeling with machine learning
    and conventional physical models. In order to develop and improve these models,
    practitioners and researchers need comprehensive benchmark datasets that are prepared
    and processed with environmental expertise that they can rely on. This study presents
    an extensive dataset of rainfall events for the state of Iowa (2016-2019) acquired
    from the National Weather Service Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) system
    and processed by a quantitative precipitation estimation system. The dataset presented
    in this study could be used for better disaster monitoring, response and recovery
    by paving the way for both predictive and prescriptive modeling.

    Networks
  abstract: The frequency and impact of floods are expected to increase due to climate
    change. It is crucial to predict streamflow, consequently flooding, in order to
    prepare and mitigate its consequences in terms of property damage and fatalities.
    This paper presents a Graph Convolutional GRUs based model to predict the next
    36 hours of streamflow for a sensor location using the upstream river network.
    As shown in experiment results, the model presented in this study provides better
    performance than the persistence baseline and a Convolutional Bidirectional GRU
    network for the selected study area in short-term streamflow prediction.

- paper_title: Wildfire Smoke Plume Segmentation Using Geostationary Satellite Imagery
  abstract: Wildfires have increased in frequency and severity over the past two decades,
    especially in the Western United States. Beyond physical infrastructure damage
    caused by these wildfire events, researchers have increasingly identified harmful
    impacts of particulate matter generated by wildfire smoke on respiratory, cardiovascular,
    and cognitive health. This inference is difficult due to the spatial and temporal
    uncertainty regarding how much particulate matter is specifically attributable
    to wildfire smoke. One factor contributing to this challenge is the reliance on
    manually drawn smoke plume annotations, which are often noisy representations
    limited to the United States. This work uses deep convolutional neural networks
    to segment smoke plumes from geostationary satellite imagery. We compare the performance
    of predicted plume segmentations versus the noisy annotations using causal inference
    methods to estimate the amount of variation each explains in Environmental Protection
    Agency (EPA) measured surface level particulate matter <2.5μm in diameter (PM2.5).

- paper_title: Deep Spatial Temporal Forecasting of Electrical Vehicle Charging Demand
  abstract: Electric vehicles can offer a low carbon emission solution to reverse
    rising emission trends. However, this requires that the energy used to meet the
    demand is green. To meet this requirement, accurate forecasting of the charging
    demand is vital. Short and long-term charging demand forecasting will allow for
    better optimisation of the power grid and future infrastructure expansions.  In
    this paper, we propose to use publicly available data to forecast the electric
    vehicle charging demand. To model the complex spatial-temporal correlations between
    charging stations, we argue that Temporal Graph Convolution Models are the most
    suitable to capture the correlations.  The proposed Temporal Graph Convolutional
    Networks provide the most accurate forecasts for short and long-term forecasting
    compared with other forecasting methods.

- paper_title: Powering Effective Climate Communication with a Climate Knowledge Base
  abstract: While many accept climate change and its growing impacts, few converse
    about it well, limiting the adoption speed of societal changes necessary to address
    it. In order to make effective climate communication easier, we aim to build a
    system that presents to any individual the climate information predicted to best
    motivate and inspire them to take action given their unique set of personal values.
    To alleviate the cold-start problem, the system relies on a knowledge base (ClimateKB)
    of causes and effects of climate change, and their associations to personal values.
    Since no such comprehensive ClimateKB exists, we revisit knowledge base construction
    techniques and build a ClimateKB from free text. We plan to open source the ClimateKB
    and associated code to encourage future research and applications.

- paper_title: Solar PV Maps for Estimation and Forecasting of Distributed Solar Generation
  abstract: Rapid uptake of distributed solar PV is starting to make the operation
    of grids and energy markets more challenging, and better methods are needed for
    measuring and forecasting distributed solar PV generation across entire regions.  We
    propose a method for converting time series data from a number of point sources
    (power measurements at individual sites) into 2-dimensional maps that estimate
    total solar PV generation across large areas.  These maps may be used on their
    own, or in conjunction with additional data sources (such as satellite imagery)
    in a deep learning framework that enables improved regional solar PV estimation
    and forecasting.  We provide some early validation and results, discuss anticipated
    benefits of this approach, and argue that this method has the potential to further
    enable significant uptake of solar PV, assisting a shift away from fossil fuel-based
    generation.

- paper_title: An Iterative Approach to Finding Global Solutions of AC Optimal Power
    Flow Problems
  abstract: "To achieve a cleaner energy system, a diverse set of energy resources
    such as solar PV, battery storage and electric vehicles are entering the electric
    grid. Their operation is typically controlled by solving a resource allocation
    problem, called the AC optimal power flow (ACOPF) problem. This problem minimizes
    the cost of generation subject to supply/demand balance and various other engineering
    constraints. It is nonlinear and nonconvex, and existing solvers are generally
    successful in finding local solutions. As the share of renewable energy resources
    increases, it is becoming increasingly important to find globally optimal solutions
    to utilize these resources to the full extent. \nIn this paper, we propose a simple
    iterative approach to find globally optimal solutions to ACOPF problems. \nFirst,
    we call an existing solver for the ACOPF problem and we form a partial Lagrangian
    from the associated dual variables. This partial Lagrangian has a much better
    optimization landscape and we use its solution as a warm start for the ACOPF problem.
    By repeating this process, we can iteratively improve the solution quality, moving
    from local solutions to global ones. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm
    on standard benchmarks. We also show how the dual variables could be found by
    using a neural network to further speed up the algorithm. "

    sunglint from aerial imagery'
  abstract: Water waves are an ubiquitous feature of the oceans, which serve as a
    pathway for interactions with the atmosphere. Wave breaking in particular is crucial
    in developing better understanding of the exchange of momentum, heat, and gas
    fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere. Characterizing the properties of  wave
    breaking using orbital or suborbital imagery of the surface of the ocean can be
    challenging, due to contamination from sunglint, a persistent feature in certain
    lighting conditions. Here we propose a supervised learning approach to accurately
    detect whitecaps from airborne imagery obtained under a broad range of lighting
    conditions. Finally, we discuss potential applications for improving ocean and
    climate models.

- paper_title: Technical support project and analysis of the dissemination of carbon
    dioxide and methane from Lake Kivu in nature and its impact on biodiversity in
    the Great Lakes region since 2012
  abstract: |-
    Straddling the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, at an altitude of 1,460 m, Lake Kivu is one of the ten great lakes in Africa, alongside the main ones that are Victoria and Tanganyika. Kivu contains very high concentrations of gases (carbon dioxide and methane in particular), produced by volcanic activity in the region and the decomposition of organic matter. It has 2,700 km2 of this body of water, a depth that approaches 500 meters in places. It is estimated to contain 60 billion cubic meters of dissolved methane and about 300 billion cubic meters of carbon dioxide accumulated over time.
    Lake Kivu, located north of Lake Tanganyika and contains a very high amount of carbon dioxide and methane. Carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) are both greenhouse gases that affect how well the planet works. The first stays in the atmosphere for a hundred years while the second stays there only for a dozen years. The effect of the dissemination of these in nature prompts me to collect as much data as possible on their circulation and to suggest possible solutions that are consistent with the Paris Agreement. In addition, many wastes come from households and/or small industries in the towns of Bukavu, Goma for the DRC and those of Gyangugu and Gisenyi for Rwanda constitute a high source of CH4 emissions which also contribute to global warming. The exploitation of methane expected in the near future is an additional threat to the sustainable development of ecosystem resources. For various reasons, Lake Kivu constitutes an adequate model for studying the responses of large tropical lakes to changes linked to human activity: indeed, despite its physical and biogeochemical peculiarities, the limnological and ecological processes of its pelagic waters are subject to the same forcings as in other large lakes in the same region, as shown by recent studies.

- paper_title: Leveraging Machine Learning for Equitable Transition of Energy Systems
  abstract: "Our planet is facing overlapping crises of climate change, global pandemic,
    and systemic inequality. To respond climate change, the energy system is in the
    midst of its most foundational transition since its inception, from traditional
    fuel-based energy sources to clean renewable sources. While the transition to
    a low-carbon energy system is in progress, there is an opportunity to make the
    new system more just and equitable than the current one that is inequitable in
    many forms. \nMeasuring inequity in the energy system is a formidable task since
    it is large scale and the data is coming from abundant data sources. In this work,
    we lay out a plan to leverage and develop scalable machine learning (ML) tools
    to measure the equity of the current energy system and to facilitate a just transition
    to a clean energy system. \n\nWe focus on two concrete examples. First, we explore
    how ML can help to measure the inequity in the energy inefficiency of residential
    houses in the scale of a town or a country. Second, we explore how deep learning
    techniques can help to estimate the solar potential of residential buildings to
    facilitate a just installation and incentive allocation of solar panels. The application
    of ML for energy equity is much broader than the above two examples and we highlight
    some others as well. The result of this research could be used by policymakers
    to efficiently allocate energy assistance subsidies in the current energy systems
    and to ensure justice in their energy transition plans."

  abstract: Wildfire impact studies are significantly hampered by the absence of a
    global long-term burned area dataset. This prevents conclusive statements on the
    role of anthropogenic activity on wildfire impacts over the last century. Here,
    we propose a workflow to construct a 1901-2014 reanalysis of monthly global burned
    area at a 0.5° by 0.5° scale. A neural network will be trained with weather-related,
    vegetational, societal and economic input parameters, and burned area as output
    label for the 1982-2014 time period. This model can then be applied to the whole
    1901-2014 time period to create a data-driven, long-term burned area reanalysis.
    This reconstruction will allow to investigate the long-term effect of anthropogenic
    activity on wildfire impacts, will be used as basis for detection and attribution
    studies and could help to reduce the uncertainties in future predictions.

    predators of the circumpolar world, is crucial to understand the processes governing
    the distribution of the Canadian Arctic biodiversity. Current methods, however,
    are unable to adequately account for complex behaviors as well as intra- and interspecific

    of Policy Makers with Deep Neural Networks and Topic Modelling'
  abstract: "Decades of research on climate have provided a consensus that human activity
    has changed the climate and we are currently heading into a climate crisis. While
    public discussion and research efforts on climate change mitigation have increased,
    potential solutions need to not only be discussed but also effectively deployed.
    \n\nFor preventing mismanagement and holding policy makers accountable, transparency
    and degree of information about government processes have been shown to be crucial.
    However, currently the quantity of information about climate change discussions
    and the range of sources make it increasingly difficult for the public and civil
    society to maintain an overview to hold politicians accountable.\n\nIn response,
    we propose a multi-source topic aggregation system (MuSTAS) which processes policy
    makers speech and rhetoric from several publicly available sources into an easily
    digestible topic summary. MuSTAS uses novel multi-source hybrid latent Dirichlet
    allocation to model topics from a variety of documents. This topic digest will
    serve the general public and civil society in assessing where, how, and when politicians
    talk about climate and climate policies, enabling them to hold politicians accountable
    for their actions to mitigate climate change and lack thereof."

    for climate change, extracting useful insights & reasoning on pivotal events,
    and helping industry leaders in making more informed future decisions. Additionally,
    we also introduce the Science Daily Climate Change dataset (called SciDCC) that
    contains over 11k climate change news articles scraped from the Science Daily
    website, which could be used for extracting prior knowledge for constructing climate

  abstract: 'A sustainable alternative to sourcing many materials humans need is metabolic
    engineering: a field that aims to engineer microorganisms into biological factories
    that convert renewable feedstocks into valuable biomolecules (i.e., jet fuel,
    medicine). Microorganism factories must be genetically optimized using predictable
    DNA sequence tools, however, for many organisms, the exact DNA sequence signals
    defining their genetic control systems are poorly understood. To better decipher
    these DNA signals, we propose a multi-task learning approach that uses deep learning
    and feature attribution methods to identify DNA sequence signals that control
    gene expression in the methanotroph M. buryatense. This bacterium consumes methane,
    a potent greenhouse gas. If successful, this work would enhance our ability to
    build gene expression tools to more effectively engineer M. buryatense into an
    efficient biomolecule factory that can divert methane pollution into valuable,

    emission from high-resolution 2-D plume imagery
  abstract: Methane (CH4) is one of the most powerful anthropogenic greenhouse gases
    with a significant impact on global warming trajectory and tropospheric air quality.
    Quantifying an emission rate of observed CH4 plumes from aerial or satellite images
    is a critical step for understanding the local distributions and subsequently
    prioritizing mitigation target sites. However, there exists no method that can
    reliably predict emission rates from detected plumes in real-time without ancillary
    data. Here, we trained a convolutional neural network model, called MethaNet,
    to predict methane point-source emission directly from high-resolution 2-D plume
    images without relying on other local measurements such as background wind speeds.
    Our results support the basis for the applicability of using deep learning techniques
    to quantify CH4 point sources in an automated manner over large geographical areas.
    MethaNet opens the way for real-time monitoring systems, not only for present
    and future airborne field campaigns but also for upcoming space-based observations
    in this decade.

- paper_title: Tackling the Overestimation of Forest Carbon with Deep Learning and
    Aerial Imagery
  abstract: |-
    Forest carbon offsets are increasingly popular and can play a significant role in financing climate mitigation, forest conservation, and reforestation. Measuring how much carbon is stored in forests is, however, still largely done via expensive, time-consuming, and sometimes unaccountable field measurements. To overcome these limitations, many verification bodies are leveraging machine learning (ML) algorithms to estimate forest carbon from satellite or aerial imagery. Aerial imagery allows for tree species or family classification, which improves on the satellite imagery-based forest type classification. However, aerial imagery is significantly more expensive to collect and it is unclear by how much the higher resolution improves the forest carbon estimation.
    This proposal paper describes the first systematic comparison of forest carbon estimation from aerial imagery,  satellite imagery, and “ground-truth“ field measurements via deep learning-based algorithms for a tropical reforestation project. Our initial results show that forest carbon estimates from satellite imagery can overestimate above-ground biomass by more than 10-times for tropical reforestation projects.
    The significant difference between aerial and satellite-derived forest carbon measurements shows the potential for aerial imagery-based ML algorithms and raises the importance to extend this study to a global benchmark between options for carbon measurements.

    with Deep Learning Super Resolution
  abstract: 'Injection into deep geological formations is a promising approach for
    the  utilization, sequestration, and removal from the atmosphere of CO2 emissions.  Laboratory
    experiments are essential to characterize how CO2 flows and reacts in various
    types of geological media. We reproduce such dynamic injection processes while
    imaging using Computed Tomography (CT) at sufficient temporal resolution to visualize
    changes in the flow field. The resolution of CT, however, is on the order of 100''s
    of micrometers and insufficient to characterize fine-scale reaction-induced alterations
    to micro-fractures. Super resolution deep learning is, therefore, an essential
    tool to improve spatial resolution of dynamic CT images. We acquired and processed
    pairs of multi-scale low- and high-resolution CT rock images. We also show the
    performance of our baseline model on fractured rock images using peak signal to
    noise ratio and structural similarity index. Coupling dynamic CT imaging with
    deep learning results in visualization with enhanced spatial resolution of about
    a factor of 4 thereby enabling improved interpretation. '

- paper_title: Forecasting emissions through Kaya identity using Neural ODEs
  abstract: 'Starting from Kaya identity, we used a Neural ODE model to predict the
    evolution of several indicators related to carbon emissions, on a country-level
    : population, GDP per capita, energy intensity of GDP, carbon intensity of energy.
    We compared the model with a baseline statistical model - VAR - and obtained good
    performances. We conclude that this machine-learning approach can be used to produce
    a wide range of results and give relevant insight to policymakers.'

- paper_title: On the Role of Spatial Clustering Algorithms in Building Species Distribution
    Models from Community Science Data
  abstract: This paper discusses opportunities for developments in spatial clustering
    methods to help leverage broad scale community science data for building species
    distribution models (SDMs). SDMs are tools that inform the science and policy
    needed to mitigate the impacts of climate change on biodiversity.  Community science
    data span spatial and temporal scales unachievable by expert surveys alone, but
    they lack the structure imposed in smaller scale studies to allow adjustments
    for observational biases. Spatial clustering approaches can construct the necessary
    structure after surveys have occurred, but more work is needed to ensure that
    they are effective for this purpose. In this proposal, we describe the role of
    spatial clustering for realizing the potential of large biodiversity datasets,
    how existing methods approach this problem, and ideas for future work.

    same is true for making significant strides in materials discovery for direct
    air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide (CO2). DAC is an emerging technology that
    captures CO2 directly from the atmosphere and it is part of the solution to achieving
    carbon neutrality by 2050. The proposed project is a collaborative effort that
    tackles climate change by using machine learning to guide scientists to novel,

    gas emissions associated with heating and cooling buildings. The framework optimizes
    room temperature set-points based on forecasts of weather, occupancy, and the
    greenhouse gas intensity of electricity. We compare two approaches: the first
    one combines a linear load forecasting model with convex optimization that offers
    a globally optimal solution, whereas the second one combines a nonlinear load
    forecasting model with nonconvex optimization that offers a locally optimal solution.
    The project explores the two approaches with a simulation testbed in EnergyPlus
    and experiments in university-campus buildings.'

- paper_title: Deep learning network to project future Arctic ocean waves
  abstract: The Arctic Ocean is warming at an alarming rate and will likely become
    ice-free in summer by mid-century. This will be accompanied by higher ocean surface
    waves, which pose a risk to coastal communities and marine operations. In order
    to develop climate change adaptation strategies, it is imperative to robustly
    assess the future changes in the Arctic ocean wave climate. This requires a large
    ensemble of regional ocean wave projections to properly capture the range of climate
    modeling uncertainty in the Arctic region. This has been proven challenging, as
    ocean wave information is typically not provided by climate models, ocean wave
    numerical modeling is computationally expensive, and most global wave climate
    ensembles exclude the Arctic region. Here we present a framework to develop a
    deep learning network based on CNN and LSTM which could be potentially used to
    obtain such a large ensemble of Arctic wave projections with an affordable cost.

- paper_title: 'Deep Learning for Spatiotemporal Anomaly Forecasting: A Case Study
    of Marine Heatwaves'
  abstract: Spatiotemporal data have unique properties and require specific considerations.
    Forecasting spatiotemporal processes is a difficult task because the data are
    high-dimensional, often are limited in extent, and temporally correlated. Hence,
    we propose to evaluate several deep learning-based approaches that are relevant
    to spatiotemporal anomaly forecasting. We will use marine heatwaves as a case
    study. Those are observed around the world and have strong impacts on marine ecosystems.
    The evaluated deep learning methods will be integrated for the task of marine
    heatwave prediction in order to overcome the limitations of spatiotemporal data
    and improve data-driven seasonal marine heatwave forecasts.

  abstract: Machine learning in remote sensing has matured alongside a proliferation
    in availability and resolution of geospatial imagery, but its utility is bottlenecked
    by the need for labeled data. What's more, many labeled geospatial datasets are
    specific to certain regions, instruments, or extreme weather events. We investigate
    the application of modern domain-adaptation to multiple proposed geospatial benchmarks,
    uncovering unique challenges and proposing solutions to them.

- paper_title: APPLYING TRANSFORMER TO IMPUTATION OF MULTI-VARIATE ENERGY TIME SERIES
    DATA
  abstract: To reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from electricity production, it
    is necessaryto switch to an energy system based on renewable energy sources (RES).
    However,intermittent electricity generation from RES poses challenges for energy
    systems.The primary input for data-driven solutions is data on electricity generation
    fromRES, which usually contain many missing values.  This proposal studies the
    useof attention-based algorithms to impute missing values of electricity production,electricity
    demand and electricity prices. Since attention mechanisms allow us totake into
    account dependencies between time series across multiple dimensionsefficiently,
    our approach goes beyond classic statistical methods and incorporatesmany related
    variables, such as electricity price, demand and production by othersources. Our
    preliminary results show that while transformers can come at highercomputational
    costs, they are more precise than classical imputation methods.
